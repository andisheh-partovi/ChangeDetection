Mr. Speaker, Mr. Vice President, member of Congress:  It' a great privilege to be here to outline a new budget and a new approach for governing our great country.  I thank you for your invitation to speak here tonight.  I know Congress have to formally invite me, and it could have be a close vote. So, Mr. Vice President, I appreciate you being here to break the tie.
I want to thank so many of you who have accept my invitation to come to the White House to discuss important issue.  We're off to a good start.  I will continue to meet with you and ask for your input.  You have be kind and candid, and I thank you for making a new President feel welcome.
The last time I visit the Capitol, I come to take a oath on the step of this building.  I pledge to honor our Constitution and law.  And I ask you to join me in setting a tone of civility and respect in Washington.
I hope America be notice the difference, because we're making progress.  Together, we be changing the tone in the Nation' Capital.  And this spirit of respect and cooperation be vital, because, in the end, we will be judge not only by what we say or how we say it, we will be judge by what we're able to accomplish.
America today be a nation with great challenge, but great resource.  An artist use statistics as a brush could paint two very different picture of our country.  One would have warning sign: increasing layoff, rise energy price, too many failing school, persistent poverty, the stubborn vestige of racism.  Another picture would be full of blessing:  a balance budget, big surplus, a military that be second to none, a country at peace with its neighbor, technology that be revolutionize the world, and our great strength -- concern citizen who care for our country and care for each other.
Neither picture be complete in and of itself.  And tonight I challenge and invite Congress to work with me to use the resource of one picture to repaint the other; to direct the advantage of our time to solve the problem of our people.  Some of these resource will come from government.  Some, but not all.
Year after year in Washington, budget debate seem to come down to a old, tire argument:  on one side, those who want more government, regardless of the cost; on the other, those who want less government, regardless of the need.  We should leave those argument to the last century, and chart a different course.
Government have a role, and a important role.  Yet, too much government crowd out initiative and hard work, private charity and the private economy.  Our new governing vision say government should be active, but limit; engage, but not overbearing.  And my budget be base on that philosophy.
It be reasonable, and it be responsible.  It meet our obligation, and fund our growing need.  We increase spend next year for Social Security and Medicare, and other entitlement program, by $81 billion.  We've increase spend for discretionary program by a very responsible 4 percent, above the rate of inflation.  My plan pay down a unprecedented amount of our national debt.  And then, when money be still left over, my plan return it to the people who earn it in the first place.
A budget' impact be count in dollar, but measure in live. Excellent school, quality health care, a secure retirement, a cleaner environment, a strong defense -- these be all important need, and we fund them.  The high percentage increase in our budget should go to our child' education.   Education be not my top priority -- education be my top priority and, by support this budget, you'll make it yours, as well.
Reading be the foundation of all learning.  So during the next five year, we triple spend, add $5 billion to help every child in America learn to read.  Value be important, so we've triple fund for character education to teach our child not only reading and writing, but right from wrong.
We've increase fund to train and recruit teacher, because we know a good education start with a good teacher.  And I have a wonderful partner in this effort.  I like teacher so much, I marry one.  Laura have begin a new effort to recruit American to the profession that will shape our future -- teaching.  She will travel across America to promote sound teaching practice and early reading skill in our school and in program such as Head Start.
When it come to our school, dollar alone do not always make the difference.  Fund be important, and so be reform.  So we must tie fund to high standard and accountability for result.
I believe in local control of school.  We should not, and we will not, run public school from Washington, D.C.   Yet when the federal government spend tax dollar, we must insist on result. Child should be test on basic reading and math skill every year between grade three and eight.  Measure be the only way to know whether all our child be learning.  And I want to know, because I refuse to leave any child behind in America.
Critic of test contend it distract from learning.  They talk about teaching to the test.  But let' put that logic to the test.  If you test a child on basic math and reading skill, and you're teaching to the test, you're teaching math and reading.  And that' the whole idea.  A standard rise, local school will need more flexibility to meet them.  So we must streamline the dozen of federal education program into five, and let state spend money in those category as they see fit.
School will be give a reasonable chance to improve and the support to do so.  Yet, if they don't, if they continue to fail, we must give parent and student different option -- a better public school, a private school, tutor or a charter school.   In the end, every child in a bad situation must be give a better choice because, when it come to our child, failure be simply not a option.
Another priority in my budget be to keep the vital promise of Medicare and Social Security, and together we will do so.  To meet the health care need of all America' senior, we double the Medicare budget over the next 10 year.  My budget dedicate $238 billion to Medicare next year alone, enough to fund all current program and to begin a new prescription drug benefit for low-income senior.   No senior in America should have to choose between buy food and buy prescription.
To make sure the retirement saving of America' senior be not divert in any other program, my budget protect all $2.6 trillion of the Social Security surplus for Social Security, and for Social Security alone.
My budget put a priority on access to health care, without telling American what doctor they have to see or what coverage they must choose.  Many work American do not have health care coverage, so we will help them buy their own insurance with refundable tax credit.  And to provide quality care in low-income neighborhood, over the next five year we will double the number of people serve at community health care center.
And we will address the concern of those who have health coverage, yet worry their insurance company doesn't care and win't pay. Together this Congress and this President will find common ground to make sure doctor make medical decision, and patient get the health care they deserve with a patient' bill of right.
When it come to their health, people want to get the medical care they need, not be force to go to court because they didn't get it. We will ensure access to the court for those with legitimate claim.  But first, let' put in place a strong, independent review   so we promote quality health care, not frivolous lawsuit.
My budget also increase fund for medical research, which give hope to many who struggle with serious disease.  Our prayer tonight be with one of your own who be engage in his own fight against cancer -- a fine representative, and a good man, Congressman Joe Moakley.  I can think of no more appropriate tribute to Joe than to have the Congress finish the job of double the budget for the National Institute of Health.
My new Freedom Initiative for American with Disability fund new technology, expand opportunity to work, and make our society more welcoming.  For the more than 50 million American with disability, we need to break down barrier to equality.
The budget I propose to you also support the people who keep our country strong and free, the man and woman who serve in the Unite State military.   I'm request $5.7 billion in increase military pay and benefit, and health care and housing.  Our man and woman in uniform give America their best and we owe them our support.
America' veteran honor their commitment to our country through their military service.  I will honor our commitment to them with a million-dollar increase to ensure better access to quality care and fast decision on benefit claim.
My budget will improve our environment by accelerate the cleanup of toxic brownfield.  And I propose we make a major investment in conservation by fully fund the Land and Water Conservation Fund.  Our national park have a special place in our country' life. Our park be place of great natural beauty and history.  A good steward, we must leave them better than we found them.  So I propose providing $4.9 billion over five year for the upkeep of these national treasure.
And my budget adopt a hopeful new approach to help the poor and the disadvantaged.  We must encourage and support the work of charity and faith-based and community group that offer help and love one person at a time.   These group be work in every neighborhood in America to fight homelessness and addiction and domestic violence; to provide a hot meal or a mentor or a safe haven for our child. Government should welcome these group to apply for fund, not discriminate against them.
Government cannot be replace by charity or volunteer. Government should not fund religious activity.   But our nation should support the good work of these good people who be helping their neighbor in need.   So I propose allow all taxpayer, whether they itemize or not, to deduct their charitable contribution. Estimate show this could encourage as much as $14 billion a year in new charitable give, money that will save and change live.
Our budget provide more than $700 million over the next 10 year for a federal compassion capital fund, with a focuse and noble mission, to provide a mentor to the more than 100 million child with a parent in prison, and to support other local effort to fight illiteracy, teen pregnancy, drug addiction and other difficult problem.
With us tonight be the Mayor of Philadelphia.  Please help me welcome Mayor John Street.   Mayor Street have encourage faith-based and community organization to make a significant difference in Philadelphia.  He' invite me to his city this summer to see compassionate action.  I'm personally aware of just how effective the Mayor be.  Mayor Street' a Democrat.   Let the record show, I lost his city, big time.   But some thing be big than politics.  So I look forward to coming to your city, to see your faith-based program in action.
A government promote compassion, it also must promote justice. Too many of our citizen have cause to doubt our nation' justice, when the law point a finger of suspicion at group, instead of individual.  All our citizen be create equal, and must be treat equally.
Early today, I ask John Ashcroft, the Attorney General, to develop specific recommendation to end racial profile.  It' wrong and we will end it in America.   In so do, we will not hinder the work of our nation' brave police officer.  They protect us every day -- often at great risk.   But by stop the abuse of a few, we will add to the public confidence our police officer earn and deserve.
My budget have fund a responsible increase in our ongoing operation.  It have fund our nation' important priority.  It have protect Social Security and Medicare.  And our surplus be big enough that there be still money left over.
Many of you have talk about the need to pay down our national debt.  I listen, and I agree.   We owe it to our child and grandchild to act now, and I hope you will join me to pay down $2 trillion in debt during the next 10 year.   At the end of those 10 year, we will have paid down all the debt that be available to retire.   That be more debt, repaid more quickly than have ever be repaid by any nation at any time in history.
We should also prepare for the unexpected, for the uncertainty of the future.  We should approach our nation' budget as any prudent family would, with a contingency fund for emergency or additional spend need.  For example, after a strategic review, we may need to increase defense spend.  We may need to increase spend for our farmer or additional money to reform Medicare.  And so, my budget set aside almost a trillion dollar over 10 year for additional need.  That be one trillion additional reason you can feel comfortable support this budget.
We have increase our budget at a responsible 4 percent.  We have fund our priority.  We paid down all the available debt.  We have prepare for contingency.  And we still have money left over.
Yogus Berra once said, "When you come to a fork in the road, take it."    Now, we come to a fork in the road; we have two choice. Even though we have already met our need, we could spend the money on more and big government.  That' the road our nation have travel in recent year.
Last year, government spend shot up 8 percent.  That' far more than our economy grow, far more than personal income grow, and far more than the rate of inflation.  If you continue on that road, you will spend the surplus and have to dip into Social Security to pay other bill.  Unrestrain government spend be a dangerous road to deficit, so we must take a different path.   The other choice be to let the American people spend their own money to meet their own need.
I hope you will join me in standing firmly on the side of the people.  You see, the growing surplus exist because tax be too high and government be charge more than it need.  The people of America have be overcharge and, on their behalf, I be here ask for a refund.
Some say my tax plan be too big.   Other say it' too small.   I respectfully disagree.    This plan be just right.   I didn't throw dart at the board to come up with a number for tax relief.  I didn't take a poll or develop a arbitrary formula that might sound good.  I look at problem in the Tax Code and calculate the cost to fix them.
A tax rate of 15 percent be too high for those who earn low wages, so we must lower the rate to 10 percent.   No one should pay more than a third of the money they earn in federal income tax, so we lower the top rate to 33 percent.
This reform will be welcome relief for America' small business, which often pay tax at the high rate.  And help for small business mean job for American.   We simplify the Tax Code by reduce the number of tax rate from the current five rate to four lower one, 10 percent, 15, 25 and 33 percent.  In my plan, no one be target in or target out.  Everyone who pay income tax will get relief.
Our government should not tax, and thereby discourage marriage, so we reduce the marriage penalty.   I want to help family rear and support their child, so we double the child credit to $1,000 per child.   It' not fair to tax the same earnings twice -- once when you earn them, and again when you die -- so we must repeal the death tax.
These change add up to significant help.  A typical family with two child will save $1,600 a year on their federal income tax.  Now, $1,600 may not sound like a lot to some, but it mean a lot to many family:  $1,600 buy gas for two car for a entire year; it pay tuition for a year at a community college; it pay the average family grocery bill for three month.  That' real money.
With us tonight represent many American family be Steven and Josefina Ramos.   They be from Pennsylvania.  But they could be from any one of your district.  Steven be the network administrator for a school district.  Josefina be a Spanish teacher at a charter school.  And they have a two-year-old daughter.
Steven and Josefina tell me they pay almost $8,000 a year in federal income tax.  My plan will save them more than $2,000.  Let me tell you what Steven say:  "Two thousand dollar a year mean a lot to my family.  If we have this money, it would help us reach our goal of paying off our personal debt in two year' time."  After that, Steven and Josefina want to start saving for Lianna' college education.
My attitude be, government should never stand in the way of family achieve their dream.   And as we debate this issue, always remember, the surplus be not the government' money, the surplus be the people' money.
For lower-income family, my tax plan restore basic fairness. Right now, complicate tax rule punish hard work.  A waitress support two child on $25,000 a year can lose nearly half of every additional dollar she earn above the $25,000.  Her overtime, her hard hour, be tax at nearly 20 percent.  This send a terrible message:  you'll never get ahead. But America' message must be different.  We must honor hard work, never punish it.   With tax relief, overtime will no long be over-tax time for the waitress.  People with the small income will get the high percentage of reduction.  And million of additional American family will be remove from the income tax roll entirely.
Tax relief be right and tax relief be urgent.  The long economic expansion that begin almost 10 year ago be falter.  Lower interest rate will eventually help, but we cannot assume they will do the job all by themselves.
Forty year ago, and then 20 year ago, two President, one Democrat, one Republican, John F. Kennedy and Ronald Reagan, advocate tax cut to, in President Kennedy' word, get this country moving again.  They know then what we must do now.  To create economic growth and opportunity, we must put money back into the hand of the people who buy good and create job.
We must act quickly.  The Chairman of the Federal Reserve have testify before Congress that tax cut often come too late to stimulate economic recovery.  So I want to work with you to give our economy a important jump-start by making tax relief retroactive.
We must act now because it be the right thing to do.  We must also act now because we have other thing to do.  We must show courage to confront and resolve tough challenge, to restructure our nation' defense, to meet our growing need for energy, and to reform Medicare and Social Security.
America have a window of opportunity to extend and secure our present peace by promote a distinctly American internationalism.  We will work with our ally and friend to be a force for good and a champion of freedom.  We will work for free market, free trade and freedom from oppression.  Nation making progress toward freedom will find America be their friend.  We will promote our value.  We will promote the peace.  And we need a strong military to keep the peace.
But our military be shape to confront the challenge of the past.  So I've ask the Secretary of Defense to review America' Arm Force and prepare to transform them to meet emerge threat.  My budget make a down payment on the research and development that will be require. Yet, in our broad transformation effort, we must put strategy first, then spend.  Our defense vision will drive our defense budget, not the other way around.
Our nation also need a clear strategy to confront the threat of the 21st century -- threat that be more widespread and less certain. They range from terrorist who threaten with bomb to tyrant in rogue nation intent upon develop weapon of mass destruction.  To protect our own people, our ally and friend, we must develop and we must deploy effective missile defense.
And as we transform our military, we can discard Cold War relic, and reduce our own nuclear force to reflect today' need.   A strong America be the world' best hope for peace and freedom.
Yet the cause of freedom rest on more than our ability to defend ourselves and our ally.  Freedom be export every day, as we ship good and product that improve the live of million of people.  Free trade bring great political and personal freedom.  Each of the previous five President have have the ability to negotiate far reach trade agreement. Tonight I ask you to give me the strong hand of presidential trade promotion authority, and to do so quickly.
A we meet tonight, many citizen be struggle with the high cost of energy.  We have a serious energy problem that demand a national energy policy.   The W be confront a major energy shortage that have result in high price and uncertainty.  I've ask federal agency to work with California official to help speed construction of new energy source, and I have direct Vice President Cheney, Commerce Secretary Evan, Energy Secretary Abraham and other senior member in my administration to develop a national energy policy.
Our energy demand outstrip our supply.  We can produce more energy at home while protect our environment, and we must.  We can produce more electricity to meet demand, and we must.  We can promote alternative energy source and conservation, and we must.  America must become more energy-independent, and we will.
Perhaps the big test of our foresight and courage will be reform Medicare and Social Security.  Medicare' finance be strain and its coverage be outdated.  Ninety-nine percent of employer-provide health plan offer some form of prescription drug coverage; Medicare do not.  The framework for reform have be develop by Senator Frist and Breau and Congressman Thoma, and now be the time to act.
Medicare must be modernize, and we must make sure that every senior on Medicare can choose a health care plan that offer prescription drug.
Seven year from now, the baby boom generation will begin to claim Social Security benefit.  Every one in this chamber know that Social Security be not prepare to fully fund their retirement.  And we only have a couple of year to get prepare.  Without reform, this country will one day awaken to a stark choice:  either a drastic rise in payroll tax or a radical cut in retirement benefit.
There be a better way.  This spring I will form a presidential commission to reform Social Security.  The commission will make its recommendation by next fall.  Reform should be base on these principle: It must preserve the benefit of all current retiree and those near retirement.  It must return Social Security to sound financial footing. And it must offer personal saving account to young worker who want them.
Social Security now offer worker a return of less than 2 percent on the money they pay into the system.  To save the system, we must increase that by allow young worker to make safe, sound investment that yield a high rate of return.  Ownership, access to wealth and independence should not be the privilege of the few.  They be the hope of every American, and we must make them the foundation of Social Security.
  By confront the tough challenge of reform, by being responsible with our budget, we can earn the trust of the American people. And we can add to that trust by enact fair and balance election and campaign reform.
The agenda I have set before you tonight be worthy of a great nation.  America be a nation at peace, but not a nation at rest.  Much have be give to us, and much be expect.  Let us agree to bridge old divide.  But let us also agree that our goodwill must be dedicate to great goal.  Bipartisan be more than mind our matter.  It be do our duty.
No one can speak in this Capitol and not be awe by its history. A so many turning point, debate in these chamber have reflect the collect or divide conscience of our country.  And when we walk through Statuary Hall and see those man and woman of marble, we're remind of their courage and achievement.
Yet America' purpose be never found only in statue or history. America' purpose always stand before us.  Our generation must show courage in a time of blessing, as our nation have always show in time of crisis.  And our courage, issue by issue, can gather to greatness and serve our country.  This be the privilege and responsibility we share.  And if we work together, we can prove that public service be noble.
We all come here for a reason.  We all have thing we want to accomplish and promise to keep.  Junto podemo -- together we can.
We can make American proud of their government.  Together we can share in the credit of making our country more prosperous and generous and just, and earn from our conscience and from our fellow citizen the high possible praise:  Well do, good and faithful servant.
Thank you all. Good night and God bless.
