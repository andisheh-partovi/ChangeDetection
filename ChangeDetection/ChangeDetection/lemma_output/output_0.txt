Mr. Speaker, Mr. Vice President, Member of the 105th Congress, distinguish guest, my fellow American: Since the last time we met in this Chamber, America have lost two patriot and fine public servant. Though they sat on opposite side of the aisle, Representative Walter Capp and Sonny Bono share a deep love for this House and a unshakable commitment to improve the live of all our people. In the past few week they've both be eulogize. Tonight I think we should begin by send a message to their family and their friend that we celebrate their live and give thanks for their service to our Nation.
For 209 year it have be the President' duty to report to you on the state of the Union. Because of the hard work and high purpose of the American people, these be good time for America. We have more than 14 million new job, the low unemployment in 24 year, the low core inflation in 30 year; income be rise; and we have the high homeownership in history. Crime have drop for a record 5 year in a row, and the welfare roll be at their low level in 27 year. Our leadership in the world be unrival. Lady and gentlemen, the state of our Union be strong.
But with barely 700 day left in the 20th century, this be not a time to rest. It be a time to build, to build the America within reach, a America where everybody have a chance to get ahead with hard work; where every citizen can live in a safe community; where family be strong, school be good, and all our young people can go on to college; a America where scientist find cure for disease, from diabetes to Alzheimer' to AIDS; a America where every child can stretch a hand across a keyboard and reach every book ever write, every painting ever paint, every symphony ever compose; where government provide opportunity and citizen honor the responsibility to give something back to their community; a America which lead the world to new height of peace and prosperity. This be the America we have begin to build; this be the America we can leave to our child if we join together to finish the work at hand. Let us strengthen our Nation for the 21st century.
Rarely have American live through so much change in so many way in so short a time. Quietly, but with gathering force, the ground have shift beneath our foot as we have move into a information age, a global economy, a truly new world. For 5 year now, we have met the challenge of these change, as American have at every turning point in our history, by renew the very idea of America: widen the circle of opportunity, deepen the meaning of our freedom, forge a more perfect Union.
We shape a new kind of Government for the information age. I thank the Vice President for his leadership and the Congress for its support in building a Government that be lean, more flexible, a catalyst for new idea, and most of all, a Government that give the American people the tool they need to make the most of their own live.
We have move past the sterile debate between those who say government be the enemy and those who say government be the answer. My fellow American, we have found a third way. We have the small Government in 35 year, but a more progressive one. We have a small Government, but a strong Nation. We be moving steadily toward a even strong America in the 21st century: a economy that offer opportunity, a society root in responsibility, and a nation that live as a community.
First, American in this Chamber and across our Nation have pursue a new strategy for prosperity: fiscal discipline to cut interest rate and spur growth; investment in education and skill, in science and technology and transportation, to prepare our people for the new economy; new market for American product and American worker.
When I take office, the deficit for 1998 be project to be $357 billion and heading high. This year, our deficit be project to be $10 billion and heading lower. For three decade, six President have come before you to warn of the damage deficit pose to our Nation. Tonight I come before you to announce that the Federal deficit, once so incomprehensibly large that it have 11 zero, will be, simply, zero. I will submit to Congress for 1999 the first balance budget in 30 year. And if we hold fast to fiscal discipline, we may balance the budget this year--4 year ahead of schedule.
You can all be proud of that, because turning a sea of red ink into black be no miracle. It be the product of hard work by the American people and of two visionary action in Congress: the courageous vote in 1993 that led to a cut in the deficit of 90 percent, and the truly historic bipartisan balance budget agreement pass by this Congress. Here' the really good news: If we maintain our resolve, we will produce balance budget as far as the eye can see.
We must not go back to unwise spend or untarget tax cut that risk reopening the deficit. Last year, together, we enact target tax cut so that the typical middle class family will now have the low tax rate in 20 year. My plan to balance the budget next year include both new investment and new tax cut target to the need of work family, for education, for child care, for the environment.
But whether the issue be tax cut or spend, I ask all of you to meet this test: Approve only those priority that can actually be accomplish without add a dime to the deficit.
Now, if we balance the budget for next year, it be project that we'll then have a sizable surplus in the year that immediately follow. What should we do with this project surplus? I have a simple four-word answer: Save Social Security first. [Applause] Thank you.
Tonight I propose that we reserve 100 percent of the surplus--that' every penny of any surplus--until we have taken all the necessary measure to strengthen the Social Security system for the 21st century. Let us say to all American watch tonight--whether you're 70 or 50, or whether you just start paying into the system--Social Security will be there when you need it. Let us make this commitment: Social Security first. Let' do that together.
I also want to say that all the American people who be watch us tonight should be invite to join in this discussion, in facing these issue squarely and form a true consensus on how we should proceed. We'll start by conduct nonpartisan forum in every region of the country, and I hope that lawmaker of both party will participate. We'll hold a White House conference on Social Security in December. And one year from now I will convene the leader of Congress to craft historic, bipartisan legislation to achieve a landmark for our generation: a Social Security system that be strong in the 21st century. [Applause] Thank you.
In a economy that honor opportunity, all American must be able to reap the reward of prosperity. Because these time be good, we can afford to take one simple, sensible step to help million of worker struggle to provide for their family: We should raise the minimum wage.
The information age be, first and foremost, a education age, in which education must start at birth and continue throughout a lifetime. Last year, from this podium, I said that education have to be our high priority. I laid out a 10-point plan to move us forward and urge all of us to let politics stop at the schoolhouse door. Since then, this Congress--across party lines--and the American people have respond, in the most important year for education in a generation, expand public school choice, opening the way to 3,000 new charter school, work to connect every classroom in the country to the information superhighway, commit to expand Head Start to a million child, launching America Read, send literally thousand of college student into our elementary school to make sure all our 8-year-old can read.
Last year I propose and you pass 220,000 new Pell grant scholarship for deserving student. Student loan, already less expensive and easy to repay--now you get to deduct the interest. Family all over America now can put their saving into new tax-free education IRA'. And this year, for the first 2 year of college, family will get a $1,500 tax credit--a HOPE scholarship that will cover the cost of most community college tuition. And for junior and senior year, graduate school, and job train, there be a lifetime learning credit. You do that, and you should be very proud of it.
And because of these action, I have something to say to every family listen to us tonight: Your child can go on to college. If you know a child from a poor family, tell her not to give up; she can go on to college. If you know a young couple struggle with bill, worry they win't be able to send their child to college, tell them not to give up; their child can go on to college. If you know somebody who' caught in a dead-end job and afraid he can't afford the class necessary to get better job for the rest of his life, tell him not to give up; he can go on to college. Because of the thing that have be do, we can make college as universal in the 21st century as high school be today. And my friend, that will change the face and future of America.
We have open wide the door of the world' best system of high education. Now we must make our public elementary and secondary school the world' best as well by raise standard, raise expectation, and raise accountability. Thanks to the action of this Congress last year, we will soon have, for the very first time, a voluntary national test base on national standard in fourth grade reading and eighth grade math. Parent have a right to know whether their child be master the basics. And every parent already know the key: good teacher and small class.
Tonight I propose the first ever national effort to reduce class size in the early grade. [Applause] Thank you. My balance budget will help to hire 100,000 new teacher who've pass a State competency test. Now, with these teachers--listen--with these teacher, we will actually be able to reduce class size in the first, second, and third grade to a average of 18 student a class, all across America.
If I've got the math right, more teacher teaching small class require more classroom. So I also propose a school construction tax cut to help community modernize or build 5,000 school.
We must also demand great accountability. When we promote a child from grade to grade who hasn't master the work, we don't do that child any favor. It be time to end social promotion in America' school. Last year, in Chicago, they made that decision--not to hold our child back but to lift them up. Chicago stop social promotion and start mandatory summer school to help student who be behind to catch up. I propose to help other community follow Chicago' lead. Let' say to them: Stop promote child who don't learn, and we will give you the tool to make sure they do.
I also ask this Congress to support our effort to enlist college and university to reach out to disadvantaged child, start in the sixth grade, so that they can get the guidance and hope they need so they can know that they, too, will be able to go on to college.
A we enter the 21st century, the global economy require us to seek opportunity not just at home but in all the market of the world. We must shape this global economy, not shrink from it. In the last 5 year, we have led the way in opening new market, with 240 trade agreement that remove foreign barrier to product bearing the proud stamp "Made in the USA." Today, record high export account for fully one-third of our economic growth. I want to keep them go, because that' the way to keep America growing and to advance a safe, more stable world.
All of you know, whatever your view be, that I think this be a great opportunity for America. I know there be opposition to more comprehensive trade agreement. I have listen carefully, and I believe that the opposition be root in two fear: first, that our trade partner will have lower environmental and labor standard which will give them a unfair advantage in our market and do their own people no favor, even if there' more business; and, second, that if we have more trade, more of our worker will lose their job and have to start over. I think we should seek to advance worker and environmental standard around the world. I have made it abundantly clear that it should be a part of our trade agenda. But we cannot influence other country' decision if we send them a message that we're backing away from trade with them.
This year I will send legislation to Congress, and ask other nation to join us, to fight the most intolerable labor practice of all: abusive child labor. We should also offer help and hope to those American temporarily left behind by the global marketplace or by the march of technology, which may have nothing to do with trade. That' why we have more than double fund for train dislocate worker since 1993. And if my new budget be adopt, we will triple fund. That' why we must do more, and more quickly, to help worker who lose their job for whatever reason.
You know, we help community in a special way when their military base close; we ought to help them in the same way if their factory close. Again, I ask the Congress to continue its bipartisan work to consolidate the tangle of train program we have today into one single "GI bill" for worker, a simple skill grant so people can, on their own, move quickly to new job, to high income, and bright future.
We all know, in every way in life, change be not always easy, but we have to decide whether we're go to try to hold it back and hide from it or reap its benefit. And remember the big picture here: While we've be enter into hundred of new trade agreement, we've be create million of new job.
So this year we will forge new partnership with Latin America, Asia, and Europe. And we should pass the new "African Trade Act"; it have bipartisan support. I will also renew my request for the fast-track negotiate authority necessary to open more new market, create more new job, which every President have have for two decade.
You know, whether we like it or not, in way that be mostly positive, the world' economy be more and more interconnect and interdependent. Today, a economic crisis anywhere can affect economy everywhere. Recent month have brought serious financial problem to Thailand, Indonesia, South Korea, and beyond.
Now, why should American be concern about this? First, these country be our customer. If they sink into recession, they win't be able to buy the good we' like to sell them. Second, they're also our competitor. So if their currency lose their value and go down, then the price of their good will drop, flooding our market and others with much cheap good, which make it a lot tough for our people to compete. And finally, they be our strategic partner. Their stability bolster our security.
The American economy remains sound and strong, and I want to keep it that way. But because the turmoil in Asia will have a impact on all the world' economy, including ours, making that negative impact as small as possible be the right thing to do for America and the right thing to do for a safe world.
Our policy be clear: No nation can recover if it do not reform itself. But when nation be willing to undertake serious economic reform, we should help them do it. So I call on Congress to renew America' commitment to the International Monetary Fund. And I think we should say to all the people we're trying to represent here that prepare for a far-off storm that may reach our shore be far wise than ignore the thunder till the cloud be just overhead.
A strong nation rest on the rock of responsibility. A society root in responsibility must first promote the value of work, not welfare. We can be proud that after decade of finger-point and failure, together we end the old welfare system. And we're now replace welfare check with paycheck.
Last year, after a record 4-year decline in welfare roll, I challenge our Nation to move 2 million more American off welfare by the year 2000. I'm please to report we have also met that goal, 2 full year ahead of schedule.
This be a grand achievement, the sum of many act of individual courage, persistence, and hope. For 13 year, Elaine Kinslow of Indianapolis, Indiana, be on and off welfare. Today, she' a dispatcher with a van company. She' save enough money to move her family into a good neighborhood, and she' helping other welfare recipient go to work. Elaine Kinslow and all those like her be the real hero of the welfare revolution. There be million like her all across America. And I'm happy she could join the First Lady tonight. Elaine, we're very proud of you. Please stand up. [Applause]
We still have a lot more to do, all of us, to make welfare reform a success--providing child care, helping family move close to available job, challenging more company to join our welfare-to-work partnership, increasing child support collection from deadbeat parent who have a duty to support their own child. I also want to thank Congress for restore some of the benefit to immigrant who be here legally and work hard, and I hope you will finish that job this year.
We have to make it possible for all hard-working family to meet their most important responsibility. Two year ago we help guarantee that American can keep their health insurance when they change job. Last year we extend health care to up to 5 million child. This year, I challenge Congress to take the next historic step.
A hundred and sixty million of our fellow citizen be in manage care plan. These plan save money, and they can improve care. But medical decision ought to be made by medical doctor, not insurance company accountant. I urge this Congress to reach across the aisle and write into law a consumer bill of right that say this: You have the right to know all your medical option, not just the cheap. You have the right to choose the doctor you want for the care you need. You have the right to emergency room care, wherever and whenever you need it. You have the right to keep your medical record confidential. Traditional care or manage care, every American deserve quality care.
Million of American between the age of 55 and 65 have lost their health insurance. Some be retire; some be laid off; some lose their coverage when their spouse retire. After a lifetime of work, they be left with nowhere to turn. So I ask the Congress, let these hard-working American buy into the Medicare system. It win't add a dime to the deficit, but the peace of mind it will provide will be priceless.
Next, we must help parent protect their child from the grave health threat that they face: a epidemic of teen smoking, spread by multimillion-dollar marketing campaign. I challenge Congress: Let' pass bipartisan, comprehensive legislation that will improve public health, protect our tobacco farmer, and change the way tobacco company do business forever. Let' do what it take to bring teen smoking down. Let' raise the price of cigarette by up to a dollar and a half a pack over the next 10 year, with penalty on the tobacco industry if it keep marketing to our child. Tomorrow, like every day, 3,000 child will start smoking, and 1,000 will die early as a result. Let this Congress be remember as the Congress that save their live.
In the new economy, most parent work hard than ever. They face a constant struggle to balance their obligation to be good worker and their even more important obligation to be good parent. The Family and Medical Leave Act be the very first bill I be privileged to sign into law as President in 1993. Since then, about 15 million people have taken advantage of it, and I've met a lot of them all across this country. I ask you to extend that law to cover 10 million more worker and to give parent time off when they have to go see their child' teacher or take them to the doctor.
Child care be the next frontier we must face to enable people to succeed at home and at work. Last year I cohost the very first White House Conference on Child Care with one of our foremost expert, America' First Lady. From all corner of America, we heard the same message, without regard to region or income or political affiliation: We've got to raise the quality of child care. We've got to make it safe. We've got to make it more affordable.
So here' my plan: Help family to pay for child care for a million more child; scholarship and background check for child care worker, and a new emphasis on early learning; tax credit for business that provide child care for their employee; and a large child care tax credit for work family. Now, if you pass my plan, what this mean be that a family of four with a income of $35,000 and high child care cost will no long pay a single penny of Federal income tax.
I think this be such a big issue with me because of my own personal experience. I have often wonder how my mother, when she be a young widow, would have be able to go away to school and get a education and come back and support me if my grandparent hadn't be able to take care of me. She and I be really very lucky. How many other family have never have that same opportunity? The truth be, we don't know the answer to that question. But we do know what the answer should be: Not a single American family should ever have to choose between the job they need and the child they love.
A society root in responsibility must provide safe street, safe school, and safe neighborhood. We pursue a strategy of more police, tough punishment, smart prevention, with crimefighting partnership with local law enforcement and citizen group, where the rubber hit the road. I can report to you tonight that it' work. Violent crime be down; robbery be down; assault be down; burglary be down--for 5 year in a row, all across America. We need to finish the job of putt 100,000 more police on our street.
Again, I ask Congress to pass a juvenile crime bill that provide more prosecutor and probation officer, to crack down on gang and gun and drug, and bar violent juvenile from buy gun for life. And I ask you to dramatically expand our support for after-school program. I think every American should know that most juvenile crime be commit between the hour of 3 in the afternoon and 8 at night. We can keep so many of our child out of trouble in the first place if we give them someplace to go other than the street, and we ought to do it.
Drug use be on the decline. I thank General McCaffrey for his leadership, and I thank this Congress for passing the large antidrug budget in history. Now I ask you to join me in a groundbreaking effort to hire 1,000 new Border Patrol agent and to deploy the most sophisticate available new technology to help close the door on drug at our border.
Police, prosecutor, and prevention program, as good as they be, they can't work if our court system doesn't work. Today there be large number of vacancy in the Federal court. Here be what the Chief Justice of the Unite State write: "Judicial vacancy cannot remain at such high level indefinitely without erode the quality of justice." I simply ask the Unite State Senate to heed this plea and vote on the highly qualify judicial nominee before you, up or down.
We must exercise responsibility not just at home but around the world. On the eve of a new century, we have the power and the duty to build a new era of peace and security. But make no mistake about it, today' possibility be not tomorrow' guarantee. America must stand against the poison appeal of extreme nationalism. We must combat a unholy axis of new threat from terrorist, international criminal, and drug trafficker. These 21st century predator feed on technology and the free flow of information and idea and people. And they will be all the more lethal if weapon of mass destruction fall into their hand.
To meet these challenge, we be helping to write international rule of the road for the 21st century, protect those who join the family of nation and isolate those who do not. Within day, I will ask the Senate for its advice and consent to make Hungary, Poland, and the Czech Republic the new member of NATO. For 50 year, NATO contain communism and kept America and Europe secure. Now these three formerly Communist country have said yes to democracy. I ask the Senate to say yes to them, our new ally. By taking in new member and work closely with new partner, including Russia and Ukraine, NATO can help to assure that Europe be a stronghold for peace in the 21st century.
Next, I will ask Congress to continue its support of our troop and their mission in Bosnia. This Christmas, Hillary and I travel to Sarajevo with Senator and Mr. Dole and a bipartisan congressional delegation. We saw child play in the street, where 2 year ago they be hiding from sniper and shell. The shop be fill with food; the cafe be alive with conversation. The progress there be unmistakable, but it be not yet irreversible. To take firm root, Bosnia' fragile peace still need the support of American and ally troop when the current NATO mission end in June. I think Senator Dole actually said it best. He said, "This be like being ahead in the 4th quarter of a football game. Now be not the time to walk off the field and forfeit the victory."
I wish all of you could have see our troop in Tuzla. They're very proud of what they're do in Bosnia, and we're all very proud of them. One of those--[applause]--thank you--one of those brave soldier be sitting with the First Lady tonight: Army Sergeant Michael Tolbert. His father be a decorate Vietnam vet. After college in Colorado, he join the Army. Last year he led a infantry unit that stop a mob of extremist from taking over a radio station that be a voice of democracy and tolerance in Bosnia. Thank you very much, Sergeant, for what you represent. Please stand up. [Applause]
In Bosnia and around the world, our man and woman in uniform always do their mission well. Our mission must be to keep them well-train and ready, to improve their quality of life, and to provide the 21st century weapon they need to defeat any enemy.
I ask Congress to join me in pursue a ambitious agenda to reduce the serious threat of weapon of mass destruction. This year, four decade after it be first propose by President Eisenhower, a comprehensive nuclear test ban be within reach. By ending nuclear test, we can help to prevent the development of new and more dangerous weapon and make it more difficult for non-nuclear state to build them. I'm please to announce that four former Chairman of the Joint Chief of Staff--General John Shalikashvili, Colin Powell, and David Jone and Admiral William Crowe--have endorse this treaty. And I ask the Senate to approve it this year. [Applause] Thank you.
Together, we must confront the new hazard of chemical and biological weapon and the outlaw state, terrorist, and organize criminal seek to acquire them. Saddam Hussein have spent the better part of this decade and much of his nation' wealth not on providing for the Iraqi people but on develop nuclear, chemical, and biological weapon and the missile to deliver them. The Unite Nation weapon inspector have do a truly remarkable job finding and destroy more of Iraq' arsenal than be destroy during the entire Gulf war. Now Saddam Hussein want to stop them from complete their mission.
I know I speak for everyone in this chamber, Republican and Democrat, when I say to Saddam Hussein, "You cannot defy the will of the world," and when I say to him, "You have use weapon of mass destruction before. We be determine to deny you the capacity to use them again."
Last year the Senate ratify the Chemical Weapon Convention to protect our soldier and citizen from poison gas. Now we must act to prevent the use of disease as a weapon of war and terror. The Biological Weapon Convention have be in effect for 23 year now. The rule be good, but the enforcement be weak. We must strengthen it with a new international inspection system to detect and deter cheating.
In the month ahead, I will pursue our security strategy with old ally in Asia and Europe and new partner from Africa to India and Pakistan, from South America to China. And from Belfast to Korea to the Middle East, America will continue to stand with those who stand for peace.
Finally, it' long past time to make good on our debt to the Unite Nation. [Applause] Thank you. More and more, we be work with other nation to achieve common goal. If we want America to lead, we've got to set a good example. A we see so clearly in Bosnia, ally who share our goal can also share our burden. In this new era, our freedom and independence be actually enrich, not weaken, by our increasing interdependence with other nation. But we have to do our part.
Our Founder set America on a permanent course toward a more perfect Union. To all of you I say, it be a journey we can only make together, living as one community. First, we have to continue to reform our Government, the instrument of our national community. Everyone know election have become too expensive, fuel a fundraise arm race. This year, by March 6th, at long last the Senate will actually vote on bipartisan campaign finance reform propose by Senator McCain and Feingold. Let' be clear: A vote against McCain-Feingold be a vote for soft money and for the status quo. I ask you to strengthen our democracy and pass campaign finance reform this year.
At least equally important, we have to address the real reason for the explosion in campaign cost: the high cost of media advertising. [At this point, audience member respond.] To the folk watch at home, those be the groan of pain in the audience. [Laughter] I will formally request that the Federal Communication Commission act to provide free or reduced-cost television time for candidate who observe spend limit voluntarily. The airwave be a public trust, and broadcaster also have to help us in this effort to strengthen our democracy.
Under the leadership of Vice President Gore, we've reduce the Federal payroll by 300,000 worker, cut 16,000 page of regulation, eliminate hundred of program, and improve the operation of virtually every Government agency. But we can do more. Like every taxpayer, I'm outrage by the report of abuse by the IRS. We need some change there: new citizen advocacy panel, a strong taxpayer advocate, phone line open 24 hour a day, relief for innocent taxpayer. Last year, by a overwhelming bipartisan margin, the House of Representative pass sweeping IRS reform. This bill must not now languish in the Senate. Tonight I ask the Senate: Follow the House; pass the bipartisan package as your first order of business.
I hope to goodness before I finish I can think of something to say "follow the Senate" on, so I'll be out of trouble. [Laughter]
A nation that live as a community must value all its community. For the past 5 year, we have work to bring the spark of private enterprise to inner city and poor rural area, with community development bank, more commercial loan in the poor neighborhood, cleanup of pollute site for development. Under the continue leadership of the Vice President, we propose to triple the number of empowerment zone to give business incentive to invest in those area. We should--[applause]--thank you--we should also give poor family more help to move into home of their own, and we should use tax cut to spur the construction of more low-income housing.
Last year, this Congress take strong action to help the District of Columbia. Let us renew our resolve to make our Capital City a great city for all who live and visit here. Our city be the vibrant hub of great metropolitan area. They be still the gateway for new immigrant, from every continent, who come here to work for their own American dream. Let' keep our city go strong into the 21st century; they're a very important part of our future.
Our community be only as healthy as the air our child breathe, the water they drink, the Earth they will inherit. Last year we put in place the toughest-ever control on smog and soot. We move to protect Yellowstone, the Everglade, Lake Tahoe. We expand every community' right to know about the toxin that threaten their child. Just yesterday, our food safety plan take effect, use new science to protect consumer from danger like E. coli and salmonella.
Tonight I ask you to join me in launching a new clean water initiative, a far-reaching effort to clean our river, our lake, and our coastal water for our child. [Applause] Thank you.
Our overriding environmental challenge tonight be the worldwide problem of climate change, global warm, the gathering crisis that require worldwide action. The vast majority of scientist have conclude unequivocally that if we don't reduce the emission of greenhouse gase, at some point in the next century, we'll disrupt our climate and put our child and grandchild at risk. This past December, America led the world to reach a historic agreement commit our Nation to reduce greenhouse gas emission through market force, new technology, energy efficiency. We have it in our power to act right here, right now. I propose $6 billion in tax cut and research and development to encourage innovation, renewable energy, fuel-efficient car, energy-efficient home.
Every time we have act to heal our environment, pessimist have told us it would hurt the economy. Well, today our economy be the strong in a generation, and our environment be the clean in a generation. We have always found a way to clean the environment and grow the economy at the same time. And when it come to global warm, we'll do it again.
Finally, community mean living by the define American value, the ideal heard 'round the world that we be all create equal. Throughout our history, we haven't always honor that ideal and we've never fully live up to it. Often it' easy to believe that our difference matter more than what we have in common. It may be easy, but it' wrong.
What we have to do in our day and generation to make sure that America become truly one nation--what do we have to do? We're becoming more and more and more diverse. Do you believe we can become one nation? The answer cannot be to dwell on our difference but to build on our share value. We all cherish family and faith, freedom and responsibility. We all want our child to grow up in a world where their talent be match by their opportunity.
I've launch this national initiative on race to help us recognize our common interest and to bridge the opportunity gap that be keeping us from becoming one America. Let us begin by recognize what we still must overcome. Discrimination against any American be un-American. We must vigorously enforce the law that make it illegal. I ask your help to end the backlog at the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. Sixty thousand of our fellow citizen be wait in line for justice, and we should act now to end their wait.
We also should recognize that the great progress we can make toward building one America lie in the progress we make for all American, without regard to race. When we open the door of college to all American, when we rid all our street of crime, when there be job available to people from all our neighborhood, when we make sure all parent have the child care they need, we're helping to build one nation.
We, in this Chamber and in this Government, must do all we can to address the continue American challenge to build one America. But we'll only move forward if all our fellow citizen, including every one of you at home watch tonight, be also commit to this cause. We must work together, learn together, live together, serve together. On the forge of common enterprise, American of all background can hammer out a common identity. We see it today in the Unite State military, in the Peace Corps, in AmeriCorps. Wherever people of all race and background come together in a share endeavor and get a fair chance, we do just fine. With share value and meaningful opportunity and honest communication and citizen service, we can unite a diverse people in freedom and mutual respect. We be many; we must be one.
In that spirit, let us lift our eye to the new millennium. How will we mark that passage? It just happen once every 1,000 year. This year Hillary and I launch the White House Millennium Program to promote America' creativity and innovation, and to preserve our heritage and culture into the 21st century. Our culture live in every community, and every community have place of historic value that tell our story as American. We should protect them. I be propose a public-private partnership to advance our art and humanity and to celebrate the millennium by saving American' treasure, great and small.
And while we honor the past, let us imagine the future. Now, think about this: The entire store of human knowledge now double every 5 year. In the 1980', scientist identify the gene cause cystic fibrosis; it take 9 year. Last year scientist locate the gene that cause Parkinson' Disease--in only 9 day. Within a decade, "gene chip" will offer a roadmap for prevention of illness throughout a lifetime. Soon we'll be able to carry all the phone call on Mother' Day on a single strand of fiber the width of a human hair. A child born in 1998 may well live to see the 22 century.
Tonight, as part of our gift to the millennium, I propose a 21st century research fund for path-breaking scientific inquiry, the large fund increase in history for the National Institute of Health, the National Science Foundation, the National Cancer Institute. We have already discover gene for breast cancer and diabetes. I ask you to support this initiative so ours will be the generation that finally win the war against cancer and begin a revolution in our fight against all deadly disease.
A important as all this scientific progress be, we must continue to see that science serve humanity, not the other way around. We must prevent the misuse of genetic test to discriminate against any American. And we must ratify the ethical consensus of the scientific and religious community and ban the clone of human being.
We should enable all the world' people to explore the far reach of cyberspace. Think of this: The first time I made a State of the Union speech to you, only a handful of physicist use the World Wide Web-- literally, just a handful of people. Now, in school, in library, home, and business, million and million of American surf the Net every day. We must give parent the tool they need to help protect their child from inappropriate material on the Internet, but we also must make sure that we protect the explode global commercial potential of the Internet. We can do the kind of thing that we need to do and still protect our kid. For one thing, I ask Congress to step up support for building the next-generation Internet. It' get kind of clog, you know, and the next-generation Internet will operate at speed up to 1,000 time fast than today.
Even as we explore this inner space in the new millennium, we're go to open new frontier in outer space. Throughout all history, humankind have have only one place to call home, our planet, Earth. Beginning this year, 1998, man and woman from 16 country will build a foothold in the heaven, the international space station. With its vast expanse, scientist and engineer will actually set sail on a uncharted sea of limitless mystery and unlimited potential.
And this October, a true American hero, a veteran pilot of 149 combat mission and one 5-hour space flight that change the world, will return to the heaven. Godspeed, John Glenn. [Applause] John, you will carry with you America' hope. And on your uniform, once again, you will carry America' flag, marking the unbroken connection between the deed of America' past and the daring of America' future.
Nearly 200 year ago, a tattered flag, its broad stripe and bright star still gleaming through the smoke of a fierce battle, move Francis Scott Key to scribble a few word on the back of a envelope, the word that become our national anthem. Today, that Star-Spangle Banner, along with the Declaration of Independence, the Constitution, and the Bill of Right, be on display just a short walk from here. They be America' treasure, and we must also save them for the age.
I ask all American to support our project to restore all our treasure so that the generation of the 21st century can see for themselves the image and the word that be the old and continue glory of America; a America that have continue to rise through every age, against every challenge, a people of great work and great possibility, who have always, always found the wisdom and strength to come together as one nation--to widen the circle of opportunity, to deepen the meaning of our freedom, to form that more perfect Union. Let that be our gift to the 21st century.
God bless you, and God bless the Unite State.
