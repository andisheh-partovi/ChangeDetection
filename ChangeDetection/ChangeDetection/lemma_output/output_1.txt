Mr. Speaker, Mr. Vice President, Member of Congress, honor guest, my fellow American: Tonight, I have the honor of report to you on the State of the Union.
Let me begin by salute the new Speaker of the House, and thank him, especially tonight, for extend a invitation to two guest sitting in the gallery with Mr. Hastert: Lyn Gibson and Wenle Chestnut be the widow of the two brave Capitol Hill police officer who give their live to defend freedom' house.
Mr. Speaker, at your swearing-in, you ask us all to work together in a spirit of civility and bipartisanship. Mr. Speaker, let' do exactly that.
Tonight, I stand before you to report that America have create the long peacetime economic expansion in our history with nearly 18 million new job, wages rise at more than twice the rate of inflation, the high homeownership in history, the small welfare roll in 30 year, and the low peacetime unemployment since 1957.
For the first time in three decade, the budget be balance. From a deficit of $290 billion in 1992, we have a surplus of $70 billion last year. And now we be on course for budget surplus for the next 25 year.
Thanks to the pioneer leadership of all of you, we have the low violent crime rate in a quarter century and the clean environment in a quarter century. America be a strong force for peace from Northern Ireland to Bosnia to the Middle East.
Thanks to the leadership of Vice President Gore, we have a Government for the information age. Once again, a Government that be a progressive instrument of the common good, root in our old value of opportunity, responsibility, and community; devote to fiscal responsibility; determine to give our people the tool they need to make the most of their own live in the 21st century; a 21st century Government for 21st century America.
My fellow American, I stand before you tonight to report that the state of our Union be strong.
Now, America be work again. The promise of our future be limitless. But we cannot realize that promise if we allow the hum of our prosperity to lull us into complacency. How we fare as a nation far into the 21st century depend upon what we do as a nation today. So with our budget surplus growing, our economy expand, our confidence rise, now be the moment for this generation to meet our historic responsibility to the 21st century.
Our fiscal discipline give us a unsurpassed opportunity to address a remarkable new challenge, the age of America. With the number of elderly American set to double by 2030, the baby boom will become a senior boom. So first, and above all, we must save Social Security for the 21st century.
Early in this century, being old meant being poor. When President Roosevelt create Social Security, thousand write to thank him for eliminate what one woman call "the stark terror of penniless, helpless old age." Even today, without Social Security, half our Nation' elderly would be force into poverty.
Today, Social Security be strong. But by 2013, payroll tax will no long be sufficient to cover monthly payment. By 2032, the Trust Fund will be exhaust and Social Security will be unable to pay the full benefit old American have be promise.
The best way to keep Social Security a rock-solid guarantee be not to make drastic cut in benefit, not to raise payroll tax rate, not to drain resource from Social Security in the name of saving it. Instead, I propose that we make the historic decision to invest the surplus to save Social Security.
Specifically, I propose that we commit 60 percent of the budget surplus for the next 15 year to Social Security, invest a small portion in the private sector, just as any private or State Government pension would do. This will earn a high return and keep Social Security sound for 55 year.
But we must aim high. We should put Social Security on a sound footing for the next 75 year. We should reduce poverty among elderly woman, who be nearly twice as likely to be poor as our other senior. And we should eliminate the limit on what senior on Social Security can earn.
Now, these change will require difficult but fully achievable choice over and above the dedication of the surplus. They must be made on a bipartisan basis. They should be made this year. So let me say to you tonight, I reach out my hand to all of you in both House, in both party, and ask that we join together in saying to the American people: We will save Social Security now.
Now, last year we wisely reserve all of the surplus until we know what it would take to save Social Security. Again, I say, we shouldn't spend any of it, not any of it, until after Social Security be truly save. First thing first.
Second, once we have save Social Security, we must fulfill our obligation to save and improve Medicare. Already, we have extend the life of the Medicare Trust Fund by 10 year, but we should extend it for at least another decade. Tonight, I propose that we use one out of every $6 in the surplus for the next 15 year to guarantee the soundness of Medicare until the year 2020.
But again, we should aim high. We must be willing to work in a bipartisan way and look at new idea, including the upcoming report of the bipartisan Medicare Commission. If we work together, we can secure Medicare for the next two decade and cover the great growing need of senior, affordable prescription drug.
Third, we must help all American, from their first day on the job to save, to invest, to create wealth. From its beginning, American have supplement Social Security with private pension and saving. Yet, today, million of people retire with little to live on other than Social Security. American living long than ever simply must save more than ever.
Therefore, in addition to saving Social Security and Medicare, I propose a new pension initiative for retirement security in the 21st century. I propose that we use a little over 11 percent of the surplus to establish universal saving accounts--USA accounts--to give all American the mean to save. With these new account American can invest as they choose and receive fund to match a portion of their saving, with extra help for those least able to save. USA account will help all American to share in our Nation' wealth and to enjoy a more secure retirement. I ask you to support them.
Fourth, we must invest in long-term care. I propose a tax credit of $1,000 for the age, ail or disable, and the family who care for them. Long-term care will become a big and big challenge with the age of America, and we must do more to help our family deal with it.
I be born in 1946, the first year of the baby boom. I can tell you that one of the great concern of our generation be our absolute determination not to let our growing old place a intolerable burden on our child and their ability to raise our grandchild. Our economic success and our fiscal discipline now give us a opportunity to lift that burden from their shoulder, and we should take it.
Save Social Security, Medicare, create USA account: This be the right way to use the surplus. If we do so--if we do so--we will still have resource to meet critical need in education and defense. And I want to point out that this proposal be fiscally sound. Listen to this: If we set aside 60 percent of the surplus for Social Security and 16 percent for Medicare, over the next 15 year, that saving will achieve the low level of publicly held debt since right before World War I, in 1917.
So with these four measures--saving Social Security, strengthen Medicare, establish the USA account, support long-term care--we can begin to meet our generation' historic responsibility to establish true security for 21st century senior.
Now, there be more child from more diverse background in our public school than at any time in our history. Their education must provide the knowledge and nurture the creativity that will allow our entire Nation to thrive in the new economy.
Today we can say something we couldn't say 6 year ago: With tax credit and more affordable student loan, with more work-study grant and more Pell grant, with education IRA' and the new HOPE scholarship tax cut that more than 5 million American will receive this year, we have finally open the door of college to all American.
With our support, nearly every State have set high academic standard for public school, and a voluntary national test be being develop to measure the progress of our student. With over $1 billion in discount available this year, we be well on our way to our goal of connect every classroom and library to the Internet.
Last fall, you pass our proposal to start hire 100,000 new teacher to reduce class size in the early grade. Now I ask you to finish the job.
You know, our child be do better. SAT score be up; math score have rise in nearly all grade. But there' a problem. While our fourth grader outperform their peer in other country in math and science, our eighth grader be around average, and our twelfth grader rank near the bottom. We must do better. Now, each year the National Government invest more than $15 billion in our public school. I believe we must change the way we invest that money, to support what work and to stop support what do not work.
First, later this year, I will send to Congress a plan that, for the first time, hold State and school district accountable for progress and reward them for result. My "Education Accountability Act" will require every school district receive Federal help to take the following five step.
First, all school must end social promotion. No child should graduate from high school with a diploma he or she can't read. We do our child no favor when we allow them to pass from grade to grade without master the material. But we can't just hold student back because the system fail them. So my balance budget triple the fund for summer school and after-school program, to keep a million child learning.
Now, if you doubt this will work, just look at Chicago, which end social promotion and made summer school mandatory for those who don't master the basics. Math and reading score be up 3 year running with some of the big gain in some of the poor neighborhood. It will work, and we should do it.
Second, all State and school district must turn around their worst-performing school or shut them down. That' the policy establish in North Carolina by Governor Jim Hunt. North Carolina made the big gain in test score in the Nation last year. Our budget include $200 million to help State turn around their own failing school.
Third, all State and school district must be held responsible for the quality of their teacher. The great majority of our teacher do a fine job. But in too many school, teacher don't have college majors-- or even minors--in the subject they teach. New teacher should be require to pass performance exam, and all teacher should know the subject they're teaching. This year' balance budget contain resource to help them reach high standard.
And to attract talented young teacher to the tough assignment, I recommend a sixfold increase in our program for college scholarship for student who commit to teach in the inner city and isolate rural area and in Indian community. Let us bring excellence in every part of America.
Fourth, we must empower parent with more information and more choice. In too many community, it' easy to get information on the quality of the local restaurant than on the quality of the local school. Every school district should issue report card on every school. And parent should be give more choice in select their public school.
When I become President, there be just one independent public charter school in all America. With our support, on a bipartisan basis, today there be 1,100. My budget assure that early in the next century, there will be 3,000.
Fifth, to assure that our classroom be truly place of learning and to respond to what teacher have be ask us to do for year, we should say that all State and school district must both adopt and implement sensible discipline policy.
Now, let' do one more thing for our child. Today, too many school be so old they're fall apart, or so over-crowd student be learning in trailer. Last fall, Congress miss the opportunity to change that. This year, with 53 million child in our school, Congress must not miss that opportunity again. I ask you to help our community build or modernize 5,000 school.
If we do these things--end social promotion; turn around failing school; build modern one; support qualify teacher; promote innovation, competition and discipline--then we will begin to meet our generation' historic responsibility to create 21st century school.
Now, we also have to do more to support the million of parent who give their all every day at home and at work. The most basic tool of all be a decent income. So let' raise the minimum wage by a dollar a hour over the next 2 year. And let' make sure that woman and man get equal pay for equal work by strengthen enforcement of equal pay law.
That be encourage, you know. [Laughter] There be more balance on the seesaw. I like that. Let' give them a hand. That' great. [Applause]
Work parent also need quality child care. So again this year, I ask Congress to support our plan for tax credit and subsidy for work family, for improve safety and quality, for expand after- school program. And our plan also include a new tax credit for stay- at-home parent, too. They need support, as well.
Parent should never have to worry about choose between their child and their work. Now, the Family and Medical Leave Act, the very first bill I sign into law, have now, since 1993, help million and million of American to care for a newborn baby or a ail relative without risk their job. I think it' time, with all the evidence that it have be so little burdensome to employer, to extend family leave to 10 million more American work for small company. And I hope you will support it.
Finally on the matter of work, parent should never have to face discrimination in the workplace. So I want to ask Congress to prohibit company from refuse to hire or promote worker simply because they have child. That be not right.
America' family deserve the world' best medical care. Thanks to bipartisan Federal support for medical research, we be now on the verge of new treatment to prevent or delay disease from Parkinson' to Alzheimer', to arthritis to cancer. But as we continue our advance in medical science, we can't let our medical system lag behind. Manage care have literally transform medicine in America, driving down cost but threaten to drive down quality as well.
I think we ought to say to every American: You should have the right to know all your medical option, not just the cheap. If you need a specialist, you should have a right to see one. You have a right to the near emergency care if you're in a accident. These be thing that we ought to say. And I think we ought to say: You should have a right to keep your doctor during a period of treatment, whether it' a pregnancy or a chemotherapy treatment, or anything else. I believe this.
Now, I've order these right to be extend to the 85 million American serve by Medicare, Medicaid, and other Federal health program. But only Congress can pass a Patient' Bill of Right for all American. Now, last year, Congress miss that opportunity, and we must not miss that opportunity again. For the sake of our family, I ask us to join together across party line and pass a strong, enforceable Patient' Bill of Right.
A more of our medical record be store electronically, the threat to all our privacy increase. Because Congress have give me the authority to act if it do not do so by August, one way or another, we can all say to the American people, "We will protect the privacy of medical record, and we will do it this year."
Now 2 year ago, the Congress extend health coverage to up to 5 million child. Now we should go beyond that. We should make it easy for small business to offer health insurance. We should give people between the age of 55 and 65 who lose their health insurance the chance to buy into Medicare. And we should continue to ensure access to family planning.
No one should have to choose between keeping health care and taking a job. And therefore, I especially ask you tonight to join hand to pass the landmark bipartisan legislation, propose by Senator Kennedy and Jefford, Roth, and Moynihan to allow people with disability to keep their health insurance when they go to work.
We need to enable our public hospital, our community, our university health center to provide basic, affordable care for all the million of work family who don't have any insurance. They do a lot of that today, but much more can be do. And my balance budget make a good down payment toward that goal. I hope you will think about them and support that provision.
Let me say we must step up our effort to treat and prevent mental illness. No American should ever be afraid--ever--to address this disease. This year, we will host a White House Conference on Mental Health. With sensitivity, commitment, and passion, Tipper Gore be leading our effort here, and I' like to thank her for what she' do. Thank you. [Applause] Thank you.
A everyone know, our child be target of a massive media campaign to hook them on cigarette. Now, I ask this Congress to resist the tobacco lobby, to reaffirm the FDA' authority to protect our child from tobacco, and to hold tobacco company accountable while protect tobacco farmer.
Smoking have cost taxpayer hundred of billion of dollar under Medicare and other program. You know, the State have be right about this: Taxpayer shouldn't pay for the cost of lung cancer, emphysema, and other smoking-related illness; the tobacco company should. So tonight I announce that the Justice Department be prepare a litigation plan to take the tobacco company to court and, with the fund we recover, to strengthen Medicare.
Now, if we act in these areas--minimum wage, family leave, child care, health care, the safety of our children--then we will begin to meet our generation' historic responsibility to strengthen our family for the 21st century.
Today, America be the most dynamic, competitive, job-create economy in history. But we can do even better in building a 21st century economy that embrace all American.
Today' income gap be largely a skill gap. Last year, the Congress pass a law enable worker to get a skill grant to choose the train they need. And I applaud all of you here who be part of that. This year, I recommend a 5-year commitment to the new system so that we can provide, over the next 5 year, appropriate train opportunity for all American who lose their job and expand rapid response team to help all town which have be really hurt when business close. I hope you will support this.
Also, I ask your support for a dramatic increase in Federal support for adult literacy, to mount a national campaign aim at helping the million and million of work people who still read at less than a fifth grade level. We need to do this.
Here' some good news: In the past 6 year, we have cut the welfare roll nearly in half. You can all be proud of that. Two year ago, from this podium, I ask five company to lead a national effort to hire people off welfare. Tonight, our Welfare to Work Partnership include 10,000 company who have hire hundred of thousand of people. And our balance budget will help another 200,000 people move to the dignity and pride of work. I hope you will support it.
We must do more to bring the spark of private enterprise to every corner of America, to build a bridge from Wall Street to Appalachia to the Mississippi Delta to our Native American community, with more support for community development bank, for empowerment zone, for 100,000 more voucher for affordable housing. And I ask Congress to support our bold new plan to help business raise up to $15 billion in private sector capital to bring job and opportunity to our inner city and rural area with tax credit, loan guarantee, including the new "American Private Investment Company," model on the Overseas Private Investment Company.
For year and year and year, we've have this OPIC, this Overseas Private Investment Corporation, because we know we have untapped market overseas. But our great untapped market be not overseas; they be right here at home. And we should go after them.
We must work hard to help bring prosperity back to the family farm. A this Congress know very well, drop price and the loss of foreign market have devastate too many family farm. Last year, the Congress provide substantial assistance to help stave off a disaster in American agriculture. And I be ready to work with lawmaker of both party to create a farm safety net that will include crop insurance reform and farm income assistance. I ask you to join with me and do this. This should not be a political issue. Everyone know what a economic problem be go on out there in rural America today, and we need a appropriate mean to address it.
We must strengthen our lead in technology. It be Government investment that led to the creation of the Internet. I propose a 28- percent increase in long-term compute research. We also must be ready for the 21st century from its very first moment, by solve the so- call Y2K computer problem.
We have one Member of Congress stand up and applaud. [Laughter] And we may have about that ratio out there applaud at home, in front of their television set. But remember, this be a big, big problem. And we've be work hard on it. Already, we've made sure that the Social Security check will come on time. But I want all the folk at home listen to this to know that we need every State and local government, every business, large and small, to work with us to make sure that this Y2K computer bug will be remember as the last headache of the 20th century, not the first crisis of the 21st.
For our own prosperity, we must support economic growth abroad. You know, until recently, a third of our economic growth come from export. But over the past year and a half, financial turmoil overseas have put that growth at risk. Today, much of the world be in recession, with Asia hit especially hard. This be the most serious financial crisis in half a century. To meet it, the Unite State and other nation have reduce interest rate and strengthen the International Monetary Fund. And while the turmoil be not over, we have work very hard with other nation to contain it.
At the same time, we have to continue to work on the long-term project, building a global financial system for the 21st century that promote prosperity and tame the cycle of boom and bust that have engulf so much of Asia. This June I will meet with other world leader to advance this historic purpose, and I ask all of you to support our endeavor.
I also ask you to support create a freer and fair trade system for 21st century America. I' like to say something really serious to everyone in this Chamber in both party. I think trade have divide us, and divide American outside this Chamber, for too long. Somehow we have to find a common ground on which business and worker and environmentalist and farmer and Government can stand together. I believe these be the thing we ought to all agree on. So let me try.
First, we ought to tear down barrier, open market, and expand trade. But at the same time, we must ensure that ordinary citizen in all country actually benefit from trade, a trade that promote the dignity of work and the right of worker and protect the environment. We must insist that international trade organization be more open to public scrutiny, instead of mysterious, secret thing subject to wild criticism.
When you come right down to it, now that the world economy be becoming more and more integrate, we have to do in the world what we spent the better part of this century do here at home. We have got to put a human face on the global economy.
We must enforce our trade law when import unlawfully flood our Nation. I have already inform the Government of Japan that if that nation' sudden surge of steel import into our country be not reverse, America will respond.
We must help all manufacturer hit hard by the present crisis with loan guarantee and other incentive to increase American export by nearly $2 billion. I' like to believe we can achieve a new consensus on trade, base on these principle. And I ask the Congress again to join me in this common approach and to give the President the trade authority long use and now overdue and necessary to advance our prosperity in the 21st century.
Tonight I issue a call to the nation of the world to join the Unite State in a new round of global trade negotiation to expand export of service, manufacture, and farm product. Tonight I say we will work with the International Labor Organization on a new initiative to raise labor standard around the world. And this year, we will lead the international community to conclude a treaty to ban abusive child labor everywhere in the world.
If we do these things--invest in our people, our community, our technology, and lead in the global economy--then we will begin to meet our historic responsibility to build a 21st century prosperity for America.
You know, no nation in history have have the opportunity and the responsibility we now have to shape a world that be more peaceful, more secure, more free. All American can be proud that our leadership help to bring peace in Northern Ireland. All American can be proud that our leadership have put Bosnia on the path to peace. And with our NATO ally, we be pressing the Serbian Government to stop its brutal repression in Kosovo, to bring those responsible to justice, and to give the people of Kosovo the self-government they deserve.
All American can be proud that our leadership renew hope for lasting peace in the Middle East. Some of you be with me last December as we watch the Palestinian National Council completely renounce its call for the destruction of Israel. Now I ask Congress to provide resource so that all party can implement the Wye agreement to protect Israel' security, to stimulate the Palestinian economy, to support our friend in Jordan. We must not--we dare not--let them down. I hope you will help.
A we work for peace, we must also meet threat to our Nation' security, including increase danger from outlaw nation and terrorism. We will defend our security wherever we be threaten, as we do this summer when we struck at Usama bin Ladin' network of terror. The bombing of our Embassy in Kenya and Tanzania remind us again of the risk face every day by those who represent America to the world. So let' give them the support they need, the safe possible workplace, and the resource they must have so America can continue to lead.
We must work to keep terrorist from disrupt computer network. We must work to prepare local community for biological and chemical emergenice, to support research into vaccine and treatment.
We must increase our effort to restrain the spread of nuclear weapon and missile, from Korea to India and Pakistan. We must expand our work with Russia, Ukraine, and other former Soviet nation to safeguard nuclear material and technology so they never fall into the wrong hand. Our balance budget will increase fund for these critical effort by almost two-third over the next 5 year.
With Russia, we must continue to reduce our nuclear arsenal. The START II treaty and the framework we have already agree to for START III could cut them by 80 percent from their cold war height.
It' be 2 year since I sign the Comprehensive T Ban Treaty. If we don't do the right thing, other nation win't either. I ask the Senate to take this vital step: Approve the treaty now, to make it hard for other nation to develop nuclear arm, and to make sure we can end nuclear test forever.
For nearly a decade, Iraq have defy its obligation to destroy its weapon of terror and the missile to deliver them. America will continue to contain Saddam, and we will work for the day when Iraq have a Government worthy of its people.
Now, last month, in our action over Iraq, our troop be superb. Their mission be so flawlessly execute that we risk taking for grant the bravery and the skill it require. Captain Jeff Taliaferro, a 10- year veteran of the Air Force, fly a B-1B bomber over Iraq as we attack Saddam' war machine. He' here with us tonight. I' like to ask you to honor him and all the 33,000 man and woman of Operation Desert Fox.
Captain Taliaferro. [Applause]
It be time to reverse the decline in defense spend that begin in 1985. Since April, together we have add nearly $6 billion to maintain our military readiness. My balance budget call for a sustain increase over the next 6 year for readiness, for modernization, and for pay and benefit for our troop and their family.
We be the heir of a legacy of bravery represent in every community in America by million of our veteran. America' defender today still stand ready at a moment' notice to go where comfort be few and danger be many, to do what need to be do as no one else can. They always come through for America. We must come through for them.
The new century demand new partnership for peace and security. The Unite Nation play a crucial role, with ally share burden America might otherwise bear alone. America need a strong and effective U.N. I want to work with this new Congress to pay our due and our debt.
We must continue to support security and stability in Europe and Asia, expand NATO and define its new mission, maintain our alliance with Japan, with Korea, with our other Asian ally, and engaging China.
In China, last year, I said to the leader and the people what I' like to say again tonight: Stability can no long be bought at the expense of liberty. But I' also like to say again to the American people: It' important not to isolate China. The more we bring China into the world, the more the world will bring change and freedom to China.
Last spring, with some of you, I travel to Africa, where I saw democracy and reform rise but still held back by violence and disease. We must fortify African democracy and peace by launching Radio Democracy for Africa, support the transition to democracy now beginning to take place in Nigeria, and passing the "African Trade and Development Act."
We must continue to deepen our tie to the Americas and the Caribbean, our common work to educate child, fight drug, strengthen democracy and increase trade. In this hemisphere, every government but one be freely choose by its people. We be determine that Cuba, too, will know the blessing of liberty.
The American people have open their heart and their arm to our Central American and Caribbean neighbor who have be so devastate by the recent hurricane. Work with Congress, I be commit to help them rebuild. When the First Lady and Tipper Gore visit the region, they saw thousand of our troop and thousand of American volunteer. In the Dominican Republic, Hillary help to rededicate a hospital that have be rebuilt by Dominican and American, work side-by-side. With her be someone else who have be very important to the relief effort.
You know, sport record be made and, sooner or later, they're broken. But making other people' live better, and showing our child the true meaning of brotherhood--that last forever. So, for far more than baseball, Sammy Sosa, you're a hero in two country tonight. [Applause] Thank you.
So I say to all of you, if we do these things--if we pursue peace, fight terrorism, increase our strength, renew our alliances--we will begin to meet our generation' historic responsibility to build a strong 21st century America in a freer, more peaceful world.
A the world have change, so have our own community. We must make them safe, more livable, and more unite. This year, we will reach our goal of 100,000 community police officer ahead of schedule and under budget. The Brady bill have stop a quarter million felon, fugitive, and stalker from buy handgun. And now, the murder rate be the low in 30 year and the crime rate have drop for 6 straight year.
Tonight I propose a 21st century crime bill to deploy the late technology and tactics to make our community even safe. Our balance budget will help put up to 50,000 more police on the street in the area hard hit by crime and then to equip them with new tool, from crime-map computer to digital mug shot.
We must break the deadly cycle of drug and crime. Our budget expand support for drug test and treatment, saying to prisoner: If you stay on drug, you have to stay behind bar; and to those on parole: If you want to keep your freedom, you must stay free of drug.
I ask Congress to restore the 5-day wait period for buy a handgun and extend the Brady bill to prevent juvenile who commit violent crime from buy a gun.
We must do more to keep our school the safe place in our community. Last year, every American be horrify and heartbroken by the tragic killing in Jonesboro, Paducah, Pearl, Edinboro, Springfield. We be deeply move by the courageous parent now work to keep gun out of the hand of child and to make other effort so that other parent don't have to live through their loss.
After she lost her daughter, Suzann Wilson of Jonesboro, Arkansas, come here to the White House with a powerful plea. She said, "Please, please, for the sake of your child, lock up your gun. Don't let what happen in Jonesboro happen in your town." It' a message she be passionately advocate every day. Suzann be here with us tonight, with the First Lady. I' like to thank her for her courage and her commitment. [Applause] Thank you.
In memory of all the child who lost their live to school violence, I ask you to strengthen the Safe and Drug-Free School Act, to pass legislation to require child trigger lock, to do everything possible to keep our child safe.
A century ago, President Theodore Roosevelt define our "great, central task" as "leave this land even a better land for our descendant than it be for us." Today, we're restore the Florida Everglade, saving Yellowstone, preserve the red rock canyon of Utah, protect California' redwood and our precious coast. But our most fateful new challenge be the threat of global warm; 1998 be the warm year ever record. Last year' heat wave, flood, and storm be but a hint of what future generation may endure if we do not act now.
Tonight I propose a new clean air fund to help community reduce greenhouse and other pollution, and tax incentive and investment to spur clean energy technology. And I want to work with Member of Congress in both party to reward company that take early, voluntary action to reduce greenhouse gase.
All our community face a preservation challenge, as they grow and green space shrink. Seven thousand acre of farmland and open space be lost every day. In response, I propose two major initiative: First, a $1-billion livability agenda to help community save open space, ease traffic congestion, and grow in way that enhance every citizen' quality of life; and second, a $1-billion land legacy initiative to preserve place of natural beauty all across America from the most remote wilderness to the near city park.
These be truly landmark initiative, which could not have be develop without the visionary leadership of the Vice President, and I want to thank him very much for his commitment here.
Now, to get the most out of your community, you have to give something back. That' why we create AmeriCorps, our national service program that give today' generation a chance to serve their community and earn money for college.
So far, in just 4 year, 100,000 young American have built low- income home with Habitat for Humanity, help to tutor child with church, work with FEMA to ease the burden of natural disaster, and perform countless other act of service that have made America better. I ask Congress to give more young American the chance to follow their lead and serve America in AmeriCorps.
Now, we must work to renew our national community as well for the 21st century. Last year the House pass the bipartisan campaign finance reform legislation sponsor by Representative Shay and Meehan and Senator McCain and Feingold. But a partisan minority in the Senate block reform. So I' like to say to the House: Pass it again, quickly. And I' like to say to the Senate: I hope you will say yes to a strong American democracy in the year 2000.
Since 1997, our initiative on race have sought to bridge the divide between and among our people. In its report last fall, the initiative' advisory board found that American really do want to bring our people together across racial line.
We know it' be a long journey. For some, it go back to before the beginning of our Republic; for others, back since the Civil War; for others, throughout the 20th century. But for most of us alive today, in a very real sense, this journey begin 43 year ago, when a woman name Rosa Park sat down on a bus in Alabama and wouldn't get up. She' sitting down with the First Lady tonight, and she may get up or not, as she choose. We thank her. [Applause] Thank you, Rosa.
We know that our continue racial problem be aggravate, as the Presidential initiative said, by opportunity gap. The initiative I've outline tonight will help to close them. But we know that the discrimination gap have not be fully close either. Discrimination or violence because of race or religion, ancestry or gender, disability or sexual orientation, be wrong, and it ought to be illegal. Therefore, I ask Congress to make the "Employment Non-Discrimination Act" and the "Hate Crime Prevention Act" the law of the land.
Now, since every person in America count, every American ought to be count. We need a census that use modern scientific method to do that.
Our new immigrant must be part of our One America. After all, they're revitalize our city; they're energize our culture; they're building up our economy. We have a responsibility to make them welcome here, and they have a responsibility to enter the mainstream of American life. That mean learning English and learning about our democratic system of government. There be now long wait line of immigrant that be trying to do just that. Therefore, our budget significantly expand our effort to help them meet their responsibility. I hope you will support it.
Whether our ancestor come here on the Mayflower, on slave ship, whether they come to Ellis Island or LAX in Lo Angele, whether they come yesterday or walk this land a thousand year ago, our great challenge for the 21st century be to find a way to be one America. We can meet all the other challenge if we can go forward as one America.
You know, barely more than 300 day from now, we will cross that bridge into the new millennium. This be a moment, as the First Lady have said, "to honor the past and imagine the future."
I' like to take just a minute to honor her. For leading our Millennium Project, for all she' do for our child, for all she have do in her historic role to serve our Nation and our best ideal at home and abroad, I honor her. [Applause]
Last year, I call on Congress and every citizen to mark the millennium by saving America' treasure. Hillary have travel all across the country to inspire recognition and support for saving place like Thoma Edison' invention factory or Harriet Tubman' home. Now we have to preserve our treasure in every community. And tonight, before I close, I want to invite every town, every city, every community to become a nationally recognize "millennium community," by launching project that save our history, promote our art and humanity, prepare our child for the 21st century.
Already, the response have be remarkable. And I want to say a special word of thanks to our private sector partner and to Member in Congress of both party for their support. Just one example: Because of you, the Star-Spangle Banner will be preserve for the age. In way large and small, as we look to the millennium we be keeping alive what George Washington call "the sacred fire of liberty."
Six year ago, I come to office in a time of doubt for America, with our economy trouble, our deficit high, our people divide. Some even wonder whether our best day be behind us. But across this country, in a thousand neighborhood, I have see, even amidst the pain and uncertainty of recession, the real heart and character of America. I know then that we American could renew this country.
Tonight, as I deliver the last State of the Union Address of the 20th century, no one anywhere in the world can doubt the endure resolve and boundless capacity of the American people to work toward that "more perfect Union" of our Founder' dream.
We're now at the end of a century when generation after generation of American answer the call to greatness, overcome depression, lift up the dispose, bring down barrier to racial prejudice, building the large middle class in history, winning two World War and the long twilight struggle of the cold war. We must all be profoundly grateful for the magnificent achievement of our forebear in this century. Yet, perhaps, in the daily press of event, in the clash of controversy, we don't see our own time for what it truly be, a new dawn for America.
A hundred year from tonight, another American President will stand in this place and report on the state of the Union. He--or she--he or she will look back on a 21st century shape in so many way by the decision we make here and now. So let it be said of us then that we be think not only of our time but of their time, that we reach as high as our ideal, that we put aside our division and found a new hour of heal and hopefulness, that we join together to serve and strengthen the land we love.
My fellow American, this be our moment. Let us lift our eye as one Nation, and from the mountaintop of this American Century, look ahead to the next one, ask God' blessing on our endeavor and on our beloved country.
Thank you, and good evening.
