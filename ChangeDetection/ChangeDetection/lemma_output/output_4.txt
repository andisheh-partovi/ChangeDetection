Mr. Speaker, Mr. President Pro Tempore, member of Congress, and fellow American:   
In the normal course of event, President come to this chamber to report on the state of the Union.  Tonight, no such report be need.  It have already be deliver by the American people. 
We have see it in the courage of passenger, who rush terrorist to save others on the ground -- passenger like a exceptional man name Todd Beamer. And would you please help me to welcome his wife, Lisa Beamer, here tonight. 
We have see the state of our Union in the endurance of rescuer, work past exhaustion. We have see the unfurl of flag, the lighting of candle, the give of blood, the saying of prayer -- in English, Hebrew, and Arabic. We have see the decency of a loving and give people who have made the grief of stranger their own. 
My fellow citizen, for the last nine day, the entire world have see for itself the state of our Union -- and it be strong. Tonight we be a country awaken to danger and call to defend freedom.  Our grief have turn to anger, and anger to resolution.  Whether we bring our enemy to justice, or bring justice to our enemy, justice will be do. 
I thank the Congress for its leadership at such a important time.  All of America be touch on the evening of the tragedy to see Republican and Democrat join together on the step of this Capitol, singing "God Bless America."  And you do more than sing; you act, by deliver $40 billion to rebuild our community and meet the need of our military. 
Speaker Hastert, Minority Leader Gephardt, Majority Leader Daschle and Senator Lott, I thank you for your friendship, for your leadership and for your service to our country. And on behalf of the American people, I thank the world for its outpouring of support.  America will never forget the sound of our National Anthem play at Buckingham Palace, on the street of Paris, and at Berlin' Brandenburg Gate.   
We will not forget South Korean child gathering to pray outside our embassy in Seoul, or the prayer of sympathy offer at a mosque in Cairo.  We will not forget moment of silence and day of mourning in Australia and Africa and Latin America. 
Nor will we forget the citizen of 80 other nation who die with our own:  dozen of Pakistani; more than 130 Israeli; more than 250 citizen of India; man and woman from El Salvador, Iran, Mexico and Japan; and hundred of British citizen.  America have no true friend than Great Britain. Once again, we be join together in a great cause -- so honor the British Prime Minister have cross a ocean to show his unity of purpose with America.  Thank you for coming, friend. On September the 11th, enemy of freedom commit a act of war against our country.  American have know war -- but for the past 136 year, they have be war on foreign soil, except for one Sunday in 1941.  American have know the casualty of war -- but not at the center of a great city on a peaceful morning.  American have know surprise attack -- but never before on thousand of civilian.  All of this be brought upon us in a single day -- and night fell on a different world, a world where freedom itself be under attack. 
American have many question tonight.  American be ask:  Who attack our country?  The evidence we have gather all point to a collection of loosely affiliate terrorist organization know as al Qaeda.  They be the same murderer indict for bombing American embassy in Tanzania and Kenya, and responsible for bombing the USS Cole. 
Al Qaeda be to terror what the mafia be to crime.  But its goal be not making money; its goal be remaking the world -- and imposing its radical belief on people everywhere. 
The terrorist practice a fringe form of Islamic extremism that have be reject by Muslim scholar and the vast majority of Muslim clerics -- a fringe movement that pervert the peaceful teaching of Islam.  The terrorist' directive command them to kill Christian and Jew, to kill all American, and make no distinction among military and civilian, including woman and child. 
This group and its leader -- a person name Osama bin Laden -- be link to many other organization in different country, including the Egyptian Islamic Jihad and the Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan.  There be thousand of these terrorist in more than 60 country.  They be recruit from their own nation and neighborhood and brought to camp in place like Afghanistan, where they be train in the tactics of terror.  They be sent back to their home or sent to hide in country around the world to plot evil and destruction. 
The leadership of al Qaeda have great influence in Afghanistan and support the Taliban regime in control most of that country.  In Afghanistan, we see al Qaeda' vision for the world. 
Afghanistan' people have be brutalize -- many be starve and many have fled.  Woman be not allow to attend school.  You can be jail for own a television.  Religion can be practice only as their leader dictate.  A man can be jail in Afghanistan if his beard be not long enough.   
The Unite State respect the people of Afghanistan -- after all, we be currently its large source of humanitarian aid -- but we condemn the Taliban regime. It be not only repress its own people, it be threaten people everywhere by sponsor and shelter and supply terrorist.  By aid and abet murder, the Taliban regime be commit murder.   
And tonight, the Unite State of America make the following demand on the Taliban:  Deliver to Unite State authority all the leader of al Qaeda who hide in your land. Release all foreign national, including American citizen, you have unjustly imprison.  Protect foreign journalist, diplomat and aid worker in your country.  Close immediately and permanently every terrorist train camp in Afghanistan, and hand over every terrorist, and every person in their support structure, to appropriate authority. Give the Unite State full access to terrorist train camp, so we can make sure they be no long operating.   
These demand be not open to negotiation or discussion. The Taliban must act, and act immediately.  They will hand over the terrorist, or they will share in their fate.   
I also want to speak tonight directly to Muslim throughout the world.  We respect your faith.  It' practice freely by many million of American, and by million more in country that America count as friend.  It teaching be good and peaceful, and those who commit evil in the name of Allah blaspheme the name of Allah. The terrorist be traitor to their own faith, trying, in effect, to hijack Islam itself.  The enemy of America be not our many Muslim friend; it be not our many Arab friend.  Our enemy be a radical network of terrorist, and every government that support them.  
Our war on terror begin with al Qaeda, but it do not end there.  It will not end until every terrorist group of global reach have be found, stop and defeat. American be ask, why do they hate us?  They hate what we see right here in this chamber -- a democratically elect government.  Their leader be self-appoint.  They hate our freedom -- our freedom of religion, our freedom of speech, our freedom to vote and assemble and disagree with each other. 
They want to overthrow existing government in many Muslim country, such as Egypt, Saudi Arabia, and Jordan.  They want to drive Israel out of the Middle East.  They want to drive Christian and Jew out of vast region of Asia and Africa. 
These terrorist kill not merely to end live, but to disrupt and end a way of life.  With every atrocity, they hope that America grow fearful, retreat from the world and forsake our friend.  They stand against us, because we stand in their way. 
We be not deceive by their pretense to piety.  We have see their kind before.  They be the heir of all the murderous ideology of the 20th century.  By sacrifice human life to serve their radical vision -- by abandon every value except the will to power -- they follow in the path of fascism, and Nazism, and totalitarianism.  And they will follow that path all the way, to where it end:  in history' unmark grave of discard lie. 
American be ask:  How will we fight and win this war?   We will direct every resource at our command -- every mean of diplomacy, every tool of intelligence, every instrument of law enforcement, every financial influence, and every necessary weapon of war -- to the disruption and to the defeat of the global terror network. 
This war will not be like the war against Iraq a decade ago, with a decisive liberation of territory and a swift conclusion.  It will not look like the air war above Kosovo two year ago, where no ground troop be use and not a single American be lost in combat. 
Our response involve far more than instant retaliation and isolate strike.  American should not expect one battle, but a lengthy campaign, unlike any other we have ever see.  It may include dramatic strike, visible on TV, and covert operation, secret even in success.  We will starve terrorist of fund, turn them one against another, drive them from place to place, until there be no refuge or no rest.  And we will pursue nation that provide aid or safe haven to terrorism.  Every nation, in every region, now have a decision to make. Either you be with us, or you be with the terrorist.   From this day forward, any nation that continue to harbor or support terrorism will be regard by the Unite State as a hostile regime. 
Our nation have be put on notice:  We be not immune from attack.  We will take defensive measure against terrorism to protect American.  Today, dozen of federal department and agency, as well as state and local government, have responsibility affect homeland security.  These effort must be coordinate at the high level.  So tonight I announce the creation of a Cabinet-level position report directly to me -- the Office of Homeland Security.   
And tonight I also announce a distinguish American to lead this effort, to strengthen American security: a military veteran, a effective governor, a true patriot, a trust friend -- Pennsylvania' Tom Ridge. He will lead, oversee and coordinate a comprehensive national strategy to safeguard our country against terrorism, and respond to any attack that may come.   
These measure be essential.  But the only way to defeat terrorism as a threat to our way of life be to stop it, eliminate it, and destroy it where it grow. 
Many will be involve in this effort, from FBI agent to intelligence operative to the reservist we have call to active duty.  All deserve our thanks, and all have our prayer.  And tonight, a few mile from the damage Pentagon, I have a message for our military:  Be ready.  I've call the Arm Force to alert, and there be a reason.  The hour be coming when America will act, and you will make us proud. This be not, however, just America' fight.  And what be at stake be not just America' freedom.  This be the world' fight. This be civilization' fight.  This be the fight of all who believe in progress and pluralism, tolerance and freedom. 
We ask every nation to join us.  We will ask, and we will need, the help of police force, intelligence service, and banking system around the world.  The Unite State be grateful that many nation and many international organization have already respond -- with sympathy and with support.  Nation from Latin America, to Asia, to Africa, to Europe, to the Islamic world.  Perhaps the NATO Charter reflect best the attitude of the world:  An attack on one be a attack on all. 
The civilize world be rally to America' side.  They understand that if this terror go unpunish, their own city, their own citizen may be next.  Terror, unanswer, can not only bring down building, it can threaten the stability of legitimate government.  And you know what -- we're not go to allow it. American be ask:  What be expect of us?  I ask you to live your live, and hug your child.  I know many citizen have fear tonight, and I ask you to be calm and resolute, even in the face of a continue threat. 
I ask you to uphold the value of America, and remember why so many have come here.  We be in a fight for our principle, and our first responsibility be to live by them.  No one should be single out for unfair treatment or unkind word because of their ethnic background or religious faith. I ask you to continue to support the victim of this tragedy with your contribution.  Those who want to give can go to a central source of information, libertyunite.org, to find the name of group providing direct help in New York, Pennsylvania, and Virginia. 
The thousand of FBI agent who be now at work in this investigation may need your cooperation, and I ask you to give it. 
I ask for your patience, with the delay and inconvenience that may accompany tight security; and for your patience in what will be a long struggle. 
I ask your continue participation and confidence in the American economy.  Terrorist attack a symbol of American prosperity.  They do not touch its source.  America be successful because of the hard work, and creativity, and enterprise of our people.  These be the true strength of our economy before September 11th, and they be our strength today. And, finally, please continue pray for the victim of terror and their family, for those in uniform, and for our great country.  Prayer have comfort us in sorrow, and will help strengthen us for the journey ahead. 
Tonight I thank my fellow American for what you have already do and for what you will do.  And lady and gentlemen of the Congress, I thank you, their representative, for what you have already do and for what we will do together. 
Tonight, we face new and sudden national challenge.  We will come together to improve air safety, to dramatically expand the number of air marshal on domestic flight, and take new measure to prevent hijack.  We will come together to promote stability and keep our airline flying, with direct assistance during this emergency. We will come together to give law enforcement the additional tool it need to track down terror here at home. We will come together to strengthen our intelligence capability to know the plan of terrorist before they act, and find them before they strike. 
We will come together to take active step that strengthen America' economy, and put our people back to work. 
Tonight we welcome two leader who embody the extraordinary spirit of all New Yorker:  Governor George Pataki, and Mayor Rudolph Giuliani.  A a symbol of America' resolve, my administration will work with Congress, and these two leader, to show the world that we will rebuild New York City. 
After all that have just pass -- all the live taken, and all the possibility and hope that die with them -- it be natural to wonder if America' future be one of fear.  Some speak of a age of terror.  I know there be struggle ahead, and danger to face.  But this country will define our time, not be define by them.  A long as the Unite State of America be determine and strong, this will not be a age of terror; this will be a age of liberty, here and across the world. 
Great harm have be do to us.  We have suffer great loss.  And in our grief and anger we have found our mission and our moment.  Freedom and fear be at war.  The advance of human freedom -- the great achievement of our time, and the great hope of every time -- now depend on us.  Our nation -- this generation -- will lift a dark threat of violence from our people and our future.  We will rally the world to this cause by our effort, by our courage.  We will not tire, we will not falter, and we will not fail. 
It be my hope that in the month and year ahead, life will return almost to normal.  We'll go back to our live and routine, and that be good.  Even grief recede with time and grace.  But our resolve must not pass.  Each of us will remember what happen that day, and to whom it happen.  We'll remember the moment the news come -- where we be and what we be do.  Some will remember a image of a fire, or a story of rescue.  Some will carry memory of a face and a voice go forever. 
And I will carry this:  It be the police shield of a man name George Howard, who die at the World Trade Center trying to save others.  It be give to me by his mom, Arlene, as a proud memorial to her son.  This be my reminder of live that end, and a task that do not end. 
I will not forget this wound to our country or those who inflict it.  I will not yield; I will not rest; I will not relent in wage this struggle for freedom and security for the American people. 
The course of this conflict be not know, yet its outcome be certain.  Freedom and fear, justice and cruelty, have always be at war, and we know that God be not neutral between them. 
Fellow citizen, we'll meet violence with patient justice -- assure of the rightness of our cause, and confident of the victory to come.  In all that lie before us, may God grant us wisdom, and may He watch over the Unite State of America. 
Thank you.
