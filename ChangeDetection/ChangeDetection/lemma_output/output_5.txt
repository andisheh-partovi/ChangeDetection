Thank you very much.  Mr. Speaker, Vice President Cheney, member of Congress, distinguish guest, fellow citizen:  A we gather tonight, our nation be at war, our economy be in recession, and the civilize world face unprecedented danger.  Yet the state of our Union have never be strong.   
We last met in a hour of shock and suffering.  In four short month, our nation have comfort the victim, begin to rebuild New York and the Pentagon, rally a great coalition, capture, arrest, and rid the world of thousand of terrorist, destroy Afghanistan' terrorist train camp, save a people from starvation, and free a country from brutal oppression.   
The American flag fly again over our embassy in Kabul.  Terrorist who once occupy Afghanistan now occupy cell at Guantanamo Bay.    And terrorist leader who urge follower to sacrifice their live be running for their own.   
America and Afghanistan be now ally against terror.  We'll be partner in rebuild that country.  And this evening we welcome the distinguish interim leader of a liberate Afghanistan:  Chairman Hamid Karzai.   
The last time we met in this chamber, the mother and daughter of Afghanistan be captive in their own home, forbidden from work or go to school.  Today woman be free, and be part of Afghanistan' new government.  And we welcome the new Minister of Woman' Affair, Doctor Sima Samar.   
Our progress be a tribute to the spirit of the Afghan people, to the resolve of our coalition, and to the might of the Unite State military. When I call our troop into action, I do so with complete confidence in their courage and skill.  And tonight, thanks to them, we be winning the war on terror.    The man and woman of our Arm Force have deliver a message now clear to every enemy of the Unite State:  Even 7,000 mile away, across ocean and continent, on mountaintop and in cave -- you will not escape the justice of this nation.   
For many American, these four month have brought sorrow, and pain that will never completely go away.  Every day a retire firefighter return to Ground Zero, to feel close to his two son who die there.  At a memorial in New York, a little boy left his football with a note for his lost father:  Dear Daddy, please take this to heaven.  I don't want to play football until I can play with you again some day. 
Last month, at the grave of her husband, Michael, a CIA officer and Marine who die in Mazur-e-Sharif, Shannon Spann said these word of farewell:  "Semper Fi, my love."  Shannon be with us tonight.   
Shannon, I assure you and all who have lost a love one that our cause be just, and our country will never forget the debt we owe Michael and all who give their live for freedom. 
Our cause be just, and it continue.  Our discovery in Afghanistan confirm our worst fear, and show us the true scope of the task ahead.  We have see the depth of our enemy' hatred in video, where they laugh about the loss of innocent life.  And the depth of their hatred be equal by the madness of the destruction they design.  We have found diagram of American nuclear power plant and public water facility, detail instruction for making chemical weapon, surveillance map of American city, and thorough description of landmark in America and throughout the world. 
What we have found in Afghanistan confirm that, far from ending there, our war against terror be only beginning.  Most of the 19 man who hijack plane on September the 11th be train in Afghanistan' camp, and so be ten of thousand of others.   Thousand of dangerous killer, school in the method of murder, often support by outlaw regime, be now spread throughout the world like tick time bomb, set to go off without warning. 
Thanks to the work of our law enforcement official and coalition partner, hundred of terrorist have be arrest.  Yet, ten of thousand of train terrorist be still at large.  These enemy view the entire world as a battlefield, and we must pursue them wherever they be.    So long as train camp operate, so long as nation harbor terrorist, freedom be at risk.  And America and our ally must not, and will not, allow it.   
Our nation will continue to be steadfast and patient and persistent in the pursuit of two great objective.  First, we will shut down terrorist camp, disrupt terrorist plan, and bring terrorist to justice.  And, second, we must prevent the terrorist and regime who seek chemical, biological or nuclear weapon from threaten the Unite State and the world.   
Our military have put the terror train camp of Afghanistan out of business, yet camp still exist in at least a dozen country.  A terrorist underworld -- including group like Hama, Hezbollah, Islamic Jihad, Jaish-i-Moham -- operate in remote jungle and desert, and hide in the center of large city. 
While the most visible military action be in Afghanistan, America be acting elsewhere.  We now have troop in the Philippines, helping to train that country' arm force to go after terrorist cell that have execute a American, and still hold hostage.  Our soldier, work with the Bosnian government, seize terrorist who be plot to bomb our embassy.  Our Navy be patrol the coast of Africa to block the shipment of weapon and the establishment of terrorist camp in Somalia. 
My hope be that all nation will heed our call, and eliminate the terrorist parasite who threaten their country and our own.  Many nation be acting forcefully.  Pakistan be now crack down on terror, and I admire the strong leadership of President Musharraf.   
But some government will be timid in the face of terror.  And make no mistake about it:  If they do not act, America will.   
Our second goal be to prevent regime that sponsor terror from threaten America or our friend and ally with weapon of mass destruction.  Some of these regime have be pretty quiet since September the 11th.  But we know their true nature.  North Korea be a regime arm with missile and weapon of mass destruction, while starve its citizen. 
Iran aggressively pursue these weapon and export terror, while a unelect few repress the Iranian people' hope for freedom. 
Iraq continue to flaunt its hostility toward America and to support terror.  The Iraqi regime have plot to develop anthrax, and nerve gas, and nuclear weapon for over a decade.  This be a regime that have already use poison gas to murder thousand of its own citizen -- leave the body of mother huddle over their dead child.  This be a regime that agree to international inspection -- then kick out the inspector. This be a regime that have something to hide from the civilize world. 
State like these, and their terrorist ally, constitute a axis of evil, arm to threaten the peace of the world.  By seek weapon of mass destruction, these regime pose a grave and growing danger.  They could provide these arm to terrorist, give them the mean to match their hatred.  They could attack our ally or attempt to blackmail the Unite State.  In any of these case, the price of indifference would be catastrophic. 
We will work closely with our coalition to deny terrorist and their state sponsor the material, technology, and expertise to make and deliver weapon of mass destruction.  We will develop and deploy effective missile defense to protect America and our ally from sudden attack.   And all nation should know:  America will do what be necessary to ensure our nation' security. 
We'll be deliberate, yet time be not on our side.  I will not wait on event, while danger gather.  I will not stand by, as peril draw close and close.  The Unite State of America will not permit the world' most dangerous regime to threaten us with the world' most destructive weapon.   
Our war on terror be well begin, but it be only begin.  This campaign may not be finish on our watch -- yet it must be and it will be wage on our watch. 
We can't stop short.  If we stop now -- leave terror camp intact and terror state unchecked -- our sense of security would be false and temporary.  History have call America and our ally to action, and it be both our responsibility and our privilege to fight freedom' fight.   
Our first priority must always be the security of our nation, and that will be reflect in the budget I send to Congress.  My budget support three great goal for America:  We will win this war; we'll protect our homeland; and we will revive our economy. 
September the 11th brought out the best in America, and the best in this Congress.  And I join the American people in applaud your unity and resolve.    Now American deserve to have this same spirit direct toward address problem here at home.  I'm a proud member of my party -- yet as we act to win the war, protect our people, and create job in America, we must act, first and foremost, not as Republican, not as Democrat, but as American.   
It cost a lot to fight this war.  We have spent more than a billion dollar a month -- over $30 million a day -- and we must be prepare for future operation.  Afghanistan prove that expensive precision weapon defeat the enemy and spare innocent live, and we need more of them.  We need to replace age aircraft and make our military more agile, to put our troop anywhere in the world quickly and safely.  Our man and woman in uniform deserve the best weapon, the best equipment, the best train -- and they also deserve another pay raise.   
My budget include the large increase in defense spend in two decade -- because while the price of freedom and security be high, it be never too high.  Whatever it cost to defend our country, we will pay.   
The next priority of my budget be to do everything possible to protect our citizen and strengthen our nation against the ongoing threat of another attack.  Time and distance from the event of September the 11th will not make us safe unless we act on its lesson.  America be no long protect by vast ocean.  We be protect from attack only by vigorous action abroad, and increase vigilance at home. 
My budget nearly double fund for a sustain strategy of homeland security, focuse on four key area:  bioterrorism, emergency response, airport and border security, and improve intelligence.  We will develop vaccine to fight anthrax and other deadly disease.  We'll increase fund to help state and community train and equip our heroic police and firefighter.    We will improve intelligence collection and share, expand patrol at our border, strengthen the security of air travel, and use technology to track the arrival and departure of visitor to the Unite State.   
Homeland security will make America not only strong, but, in many way, better.  Knowledge gain from bioterrorism research will improve public health.  Strong police and fire department will mean safe neighborhood.  Strict border enforcement will help combat illegal drug.    And as government work to better secure our homeland, America will continue to depend on the eye and ear of alert citizen. 
A few day before Christmas, a airline flight attendant spot a passenger lighting a match.  The crew and passenger quickly subdue the man, who have be train by al Qaeda and be arm with explosive.  The people on that plane be alert and, as a result, likely save nearly 200 live.  And tonight we welcome and thank flight attendant Hermi Moutardy and Christina Jone.   
Once we have fund our national security and our homeland security, the final great priority of my budget be economic security for the American people.    To achieve these great national objective -- to win the war, protect the homeland, and revitalize our economy -- our budget will run a deficit that will be small and short-term, so long as Congress restrain spend and act in a fiscally responsible manner.   We have clear priority and we must act at home with the same purpose and resolve we have show overseas:  We'll prevail in the war, and we will defeat this recession.   
American who have lost their job need our help and I support extend unemployment benefit and direct assistance for health care coverage.    Yet, American worker want more than unemployment check -- they want a steady paycheck.    When America work, America prosper, so my economic security plan can be sum up in one word:  job.   
Good job begin with good school, and here we've made a fine start. Republican and Democrat work together to achieve historic education reform so that no child be left behind.  I be proud to work with member of both party:  Chairman John Boehner and Congressman George Miller.    Senator Judd Gregg.    And I be so proud of our work, I even have nice thing to say about my friend, T Kennedy. (Laughter and applause.)  I know the folk at the Crawford coffee shop couldn't believe I' say such a thing -- (laughter) -- but our work on this bill show what be possible if we set aside posture and focus on result.   
There be more to do.  We need to prepare our child to read and succeed in school with improve Head Start and early childhood development program.    We must upgrade our teacher college and teacher train and launch a major recruit drive with a great goal for America:  a quality teacher in every classroom.   
Good job also depend on reliable and affordable energy.  This Congress must act to encourage conservation, promote technology, build infrastructure, and it must act to increase energy production at home so America be less dependent on foreign oil.   
Good job depend on expand trade. Sel into new market create new job, so I ask Congress to finally approve trade promotion authority.    On these two key issue, trade and energy, the House of Representative have act to create job, and I urge the Senate to pass this legislation.   
Good job depend on sound tax policy. Last year, some in this hall thought my tax relief plan be too small; some thought it be too big.    But when the check arrive in the mail, most American thought tax relief be just about right.    Congress listen to the people and respond by reduce tax rate, double the child credit, and ending the death tax.  For the sake of long-term growth and to help American plan for the future, let' make these tax cut permanent.   
The way out of this recession, the way to create job, be to grow the economy by encourage investment in factory and equipment, and by speeding up tax relief so people have more money to spend.  For the sake of American worker, let' pass a stimulus package.   
Good job must be the aim of welfare reform.  A we reauthorize these important reform, we must always remember the goal be to reduce dependency on government and offer every American the dignity of a job.   
American know economic security can vanish in a instant without health security.  I ask Congress to join me this year to enact a patient' bill of right  to give uninsure worker credit to help buy health coverage  to approve a historic increase in the spend for veteran' health  and to give senior a sound and modern Medicare system that include coverage for prescription drug.   
A good job should lead to security in retirement.  I ask Congress to enact new safeguard for 401K and pension plan.    Employee who have work hard and save all their live should not have to risk lose everything if their company fail.    Through strict accounting standard and tough disclosure requirement, corporate America must be made more accountable to employee and shareholder and held to the high standard of conduct.   
Retirement security also depend upon keeping the commitment of Social Security, and we will.  We must make Social Security financially stable and allow personal retirement account for young worker who choose them.   
Member, you and I will work together in the month ahead on other issue:  productive farm policy  a cleaner environment  broad home ownership, especially among minority  and way to encourage the good work of charity and faith-based group.    I ask you to join me on these important domestic issue in the same spirit of cooperation we've apply to our war against terrorism.   
Dure these last few month, I've be humble and privileged to see the true character of this country in a time of test.  Our enemy believe America be weak and materialistic, that we would splinter in fear and selfishness.  They be as wrong as they be evil.   
The American people have respond magnificently, with courage and compassion, strength and resolve.  A I have met the hero, hug the family, and look into the tire face of rescuer, I have stand in awe of the American people. 
And I hope you will join me -- I hope you will join me in express thanks to one American for the strength and calm and comfort she bring to our nation in crisis, our First Lady, Laura Bush.   
None of us would ever wish the evil that be do on September the 11th.  Yet after America be attack, it be as if our entire country look into a mirror and saw our better self.  We be remind that we be citizen, with obligation to each other, to our country, and to history.  We begin to think less of the good we can accumulate, and more about the good we can do. 
For too long our culture have said, "If it feel good, do it."  Now America be embrace a new ethic and a new creed: "Let' roll."  In the sacrifice of soldier, the fierce brotherhood of firefighter, and the bravery and generosity of ordinary citizen, we have glimpse what a new culture of responsibility could look like.  We want to be a nation that serve goal large than self.  We've be offer a unique opportunity, and we must not let this moment pass.   
My call tonight be for every American to commit at least two year -- 4,000 hour over the rest of your lifetime -- to the service of your neighbor and your nation.    Many be already serving, and I thank you.  If you aren't sure how to help, I've got a good place to start.  To sustain and extend the best that have emerge in America, I invite you to join the new USA Freedom Corps.  The Freedom Corps will focus on three area of need:  respond in case of crisis at home; rebuild our community; and extend American compassion throughout the world. 
One purpose of the USA Freedom Corps will be homeland security. America need retire doctor and nurse who can be mobilize in major emergency; volunteer to help police and fire department; transportation and utility worker well-train in spot danger. 
Our country also need citizen work to rebuild our community.  We need mentor to love child, especially child whose parent be in prison.  And we need more talented teacher in trouble school.  USA Freedom Corps will expand and improve the good effort of AmeriCorps and Senior Corps to recruit more than 200,000 new volunteer. 
And America need citizen to extend the compassion of our country to every part of the world.  So we will renew the promise of the Peace Corps, double its volunteer over the next five year  and ask it to join a new effort to encourage development and education and opportunity in the Islamic world.   
This time of adversity offer a unique moment of opportunity -- a moment we must seize to change our culture.  Through the gathering momentum of million of act of service and decency and kindness, I know we can overcome evil with great good.    And we have a great opportunity during this time of war to lead the world toward the value that will bring lasting peace. 
All father and mother, in all society, want their child to be educate, and live free from poverty and violence.  No people on Earth yearn to be oppress, or aspire to servitude, or eagerly await the midnight knock of the secret police. 
If anyone doubt this, let them look to Afghanistan, where the Islamic "street" greet the fall of tyranny with song and celebration.  Let the skeptic look to Islam' own rich history, with its century of learning, and tolerance and progress. America will lead by defend liberty and justice because they be right and true and unchange for all people everywhere.   
No nation own these aspiration, and no nation be exempt from them.  We have no intention of imposing our culture.  But America will always stand firm for the non-negotiable demand of human dignity:  the rule of law; limit on the power of the state; respect for woman; private property; free speech; equal justice; and religious tolerance.   
America will take the side of brave man and woman who advocate these value around the world, including the Islamic world, because we have a great objective than eliminate threat and contain resentment.  We seek a just and peaceful world beyond the war on terror. 
In this moment of opportunity, a common danger be erase old rivalry.  America be work with Russia and China and India, in way we have never before, to achieve peace and prosperity.  In every region, free market and free trade and free society be prove their power to lift live.  Together with friend and ally from Europe to Asia, and Africa to Latin America, we will demonstrate that the force of terror cannot stop the momentum of freedom.   
The last time I spoke here, I express the hope that life would return to normal.  In some way, it have.  In others, it never will.  Those of us who have live through these challenging time have be change by them.  We've come to know truth that we will never question:  evil be real, and it must be oppose.    Beyond all difference of race or creed, we be one country, mourning together and facing danger together.  Deep in the American character, there be honor, and it be strong than cynicism.  And many have discover again that even in tragedy -- especially in tragedy -- God be near.   
In a single instant, we realize that this will be a decisive decade in the history of liberty, that we've be call to a unique role in human event.  Rarely have the world face a choice more clear or consequential. 
Our enemy send other people' child on mission of suicide and murder.  They embrace tyranny and death as a cause and a creed.  We stand for a different choice, made long ago, on the day of our found.  We affirm it again today.  We choose freedom and the dignity of every life.  
Steadfast in our purpose, we now press on.  We have know freedom' price.  We have show freedom' power.  And in this great conflict, my fellow American, we will see freedom' victory. 
Thank you all.  May God bless.
