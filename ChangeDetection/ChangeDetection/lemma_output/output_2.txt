Mr. Speaker, Mr. Vice President, Member of Congress, honor guest, my fellow American:
We be fortunate to be alive at this moment in history. Never before have our Nation enjoy, at once, so much prosperity and social progress with so little internal crisis and so few external threat. Never before have we have such a bless opportunity and, therefore, such a profound obligation to build the more perfect Union of our Founder' dream.
We begin the new century with over 20 million new job; the fast economic growth in more than 30 year; the low unemployment rate in 30 year; the low poverty rate in 20 year; the low African- American and Hispanic unemployment rate on record; the first back-to- back surplus in 42 year; and next month, America will achieve the long period of economic growth in our entire history. We have built a new economy.
And our economic revolution have be match by a revival of the American spirit: crime down by 20 percent, to its low level in 25 year; teen birth down 7 year in a row; adoption up by 30 percent; welfare roll cut in half to their low level in 30 year.
My fellow American, the state of our Union be the strong it have ever be.
A always, the real credit belong to the American people. My gratitude also go to those of you in this Chamber who have work with us to put progress over partisanship.
Eight year ago, it be not so clear to most American there would be much to celebrate in the year 2000. Then our Nation be grip by economic distress, social decline, political gridlock. The title of a best-selling book ask: "America: What Went Wrong?"
In the best tradition of our Nation, American determine to set thing right. We restore the vital center, replace outmoded ideology with a new vision anchor in basic, endure value: opportunity for all, responsibility from all, a community of all American. We reinvent Government, transform it into a catalyst for new idea that stress both opportunity and responsibility and give our people the tool they need to solve their own problem.
With the small Federal work force in 40 year, we turn record deficit into record surplus and double our investment in education. We cut crime with 100,000 community police and the Brady law, which have kept gun out of the hand of half a million criminal.
We end welfare as we know it, require work while protect health care and nutrition for child and invest more in child care, transportation, and housing to help their parent go to work. We've help parent to succeed at home and at work with family leave, which 20 million American have now use to care for a newborn child or a sick love one. We've engage 150,000 young American in citizen service through AmeriCorps, while helping them earn money for college.
In 1992 we just have a roadmap. Today, we have result.
Even more important, America again have the confidence to dream big dream. But we must not let this confidence drift into complacency. For we, all of us, will be judge by the dream and deed we pass on to our child. And on that score, we will be held to a high standard, indeed, because our chance to do good be so great.
My fellow American, we have cross the bridge we built to the 21st century. Now, we must shape a 21st century American revolution of opportunity, responsibility, and community. We must be now, as we be in the beginning, a new nation.
At the dawn of the last century, Theodore Roosevelt said, "The one characteristic more essential than any other be foresight . . . it should be the growing Nation with a future that take the long look ahead." So tonight, let us take our long look ahead and set great goal for our Nation.
To 21st century America, let us pledge these thing: Every child will begin school ready to learn and graduate ready to succeed. Every family will be able to succeed at home and at work, and no child will be raise in poverty. We will meet the challenge of the age of America. We will assure quality, affordable health care, at last, for all American.
We will make America the safe big country on Earth. We will pay off our national debt for the first time since 1835.* We will bring prosperity to every American community. We will reverse the course of climate change and leave a safe, cleaner planet. America will lead the world toward share peace and prosperity and the far frontier of science and technology. And we will become at last what our Founder pledge us to be so long ago: One Nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.
[* White House correction.]
These be great goal, worthy of a great nation. We will not reach them all this year, not even in this decade. But we will reach them. Let us remember that the first American Revolution be not win with a single shot; the continent be not settle in a single year. The lesson of our history and the lesson of the last 7 year be that great goal be reach step by step, always building on our progress, always gain ground.
Of course, you can't gain ground if you're standing still. And for too long this Congress have be standing still on some of our most pressing national priority. So let' begin tonight with them.
Again, I ask you to pass a real Patient' Bill of Right. I ask you to pass commonsense gun safety legislation. I ask you to pass campaign finance reform. I ask you to vote up or down on judicial nomination and other important appointee. And again, I ask you--I implore you to raise the minimum wage.
Now, 2 year ago--let me try to balance the seesaw here-- [laughter]--2 year ago, as we reach across party line to reach our first balance budget, I ask that we meet our responsibility to the next generation by maintain our fiscal discipline. Because we refuse to stray from that path, we be do something that would have seem unimaginable 7 year ago. We be actually paying down the national debt. Now, if we stay on this path, we can pay down the debt entirely in just 13 year now and make America debt-free for the first time since Andraw Jackson be President in 1835.
In 1993 we begin to put our fiscal house in order with the Deficit Reduction Act, which you'll all remember win passage in both House by just a single vote. Your former colleague, my first Secretary of the Treasury, led that effort and spark our long boom. He' here with us tonight. Lloyd Bentsen, you have serve America well, and we thank you.
Beyond paying off the debt, we must ensure that the benefit of debt reduction go to preserve two of the most important guarantee we make to every American, Social Security and Medicare. Tonight I ask you to work with me to make a bipartisan downpayment on Social Security reform by credit the interest saving from debt reduction to the Social Security Trust Fund so that it will be strong and sound for the next 50 year.
But this be just the start of our journey. We must also take the right step toward reach our great goal. First and foremost, we need a 21st century revolution in education, guide by our faith that every single child can learn. Because education be more important than ever, more than ever the key to our child' future, we must make sure all our child have that key. That mean quality pre-school and after- school, the best train teacher in the classroom, and college opportunity for all our child.
For 7 year now, we've work hard to improve our school, with opportunity and responsibility, invest more but demanding more in turn. Reading, math, college entrance score be up. Some of the most impressive gain be in school in very poor neighborhood.
But all successful school have follow the same prove formula: high standard, more accountability, and extra help so child who need it can get it to reach those standard. I have sent Congress a reform plan base on that formula. It hold State and school district accountable for progress and reward them for result. Each year, our National Government invest more than $15 billion in our school. It be time to support what work and stop support what doesn't.
Now, as we demand more from our school, we should also invest more in our school. Let' double our investment to help State and district turn around their worst-performing school or shut them down. Let' double our investment in after-school and summer school program, which boost achievement and keep people off the street and out of trouble. If we do this, we can give every single child in every failing school in America--everyone--the chance to meet high standard.
Since 1993, we've nearly double our investment in Head Start and improve its quality. Tonight I ask you for another $1 billion for Head Start, the large increase in the history of the program.
We know that child learn best in small class with good teacher. For 2 year in a row, Congress have support my plan to hire 100,000 new qualify teacher to lower class size in the early grade. I thank you for that, and I ask you to make it three in a row. And to make sure all teacher know the subject they teach, tonight I propose a new teacher quality initiative, to recruit more talented people into the classroom, reward good teacher for stay there, and give all teacher the train they need.
We know charter school provide real public school choice. When I become President, there be just one independent public charter school in all America. Today, thanks to you, there be 1,700. I ask you now to help us meet our goal of 3,000 charter school by next year.
We know we must connect all our classroom to the Internet, and we're get there. In 1994, only 3 percent of our classroom be connect. Today, with the help of the Vice President' E-rate program, more than half of them be. And 90 percent of our school have at least one Internet connection. But we cannot finish the job when a third of all our school be in serious disrepair. Many of them have wall and wire so old, they're too old for the Internet. So tonight, I propose to help 5,000 school a year make immediate and urgent repair and, again, to help build or modernize 6,000 more, to get student out of trailer and into high-tech classroom.
I ask all of you to help me double our bipartisan GEAR UP program, which provide mentor for disadvantaged young people. If we double it, we can provide mentor for 1.4 million of them. Let' also offer these kid from disadvantaged background the same chance to take the same college test-prep course wealthy student use to boost their test score.
To make the American dream achievable for all, we must make college affordable for all. For 7 year, on a bipartisan basis, we have taken action toward that goal: large Pell grant, more affordable student loan, education IRA', and our HOPE scholarship, which have already benefit 5 million young people.
Now, 67 percent of high school graduate be go on to college. That' up 10 percent since 1993. Yet million of family still strain to pay college tuition. They need help. So I propose a landmark $30- billion college opportunity tax cut, a middle class tax deduction for up to $10,000 in college tuition cost. The previous action of this Congress have already made 2 year of college affordable for all. It' time make 4 year of college affordable for all. If we take all these step, we'll move a long way toward making sure every child start school ready to learn and graduate ready to succeed.
We also need a 21st century revolution to reward work and strengthen family by give every parent the tool to succeed at work and at the most important work of all, raise child. That mean making sure every family have health care and the support to care for age parent, the tool to bring their child up right, and that no child grow up in poverty.
From my first day as President, we've work to give family better access to better health care. In 1997, we pass the Child' Health Insurance Program--CHIP--so that worker who don't have coverage through their employer at least can get it for their child. So far, we've enroll 2 million child; we're well on our way to our goal of 5 million.
But there be still more than 40 million of our fellow American without health insurance, more than there be in 1993. Tonight I propose that we follow Vice President Gore' suggestion to make low income parent eligible for the insurance that cover their child. Together with our child' initiative--think of this--together with our child' initiative, this action would enable us to cover nearly a quarter of all the uninsure people in America.
Again, I want to ask you to let people between the age of 55 and 65, the fast growing group of uninsure, buy into Medicare. And this year I propose to give them a tax credit to make that choice a affordable one. I hope you will support that, as well.
When the baby boomer retire, Medicare will be face with care for twice as many of our citizen; yet, it be far from ready to do so. My generation must not ask our child' generation to shoulder our burden. We simply must act now to strengthen and modernize Medicare.
My budget include a comprehensive plan to reform Medicare, to make it more efficient and more competitive. And it dedicate nearly $400 billion of our budget surplus to keep Medicare solvent past 2025. And at long last, it also provide fund to give every senior a voluntary choice of affordable coverage for prescription drug.
Lifesaving drug be a indispensable part of modern medicine. No one create a Medicare program today would even think of exclude coverage for prescription drug. Yet more than three in five of our senior now lack dependable drug coverage which can lengthen and enrich their live. Million of old American, who need prescription drug the most, pay the high price for them. In good conscience, we cannot let another year pass without extend to all our senior this lifeline of affordable prescription drug.
Record number of American be providing for age or ail love one at home. It' a loving but a difficult and often very expensive choice. Last year I propose a $1,000 tax credit for long-term care. Frankly, it wasn't enough. This year let' triple it to $3,000. But this year, let' pass it.
We also have to make need investment to expand access to mental health care. I want to take a moment to thank the person who led our first White House Conference on Mental Health last year and who for 7 year have led all our effort to break down the barrier to decent treatment of people with mental illness. Thank you, Tipper Gore.
Taken together, these proposal would mark the large investment in health care in the 35 year since Medicare be created--the large investment in 35 year. That would be a big step toward assure quality health care for all American, young and old. And I ask you to embrace them and pass them.
We must also make investment that reward work and support family. Nothing do that better than the earned-income tax credit, the EITC. The "E" in the EITC be about earn, work, taking responsibility, and being reward for it. In my very first address to you, I ask Congress to greatly expand this credit, and you do. A a result, in 1998 alone, the EITC help more than 4.3 million American work their way out of poverty toward the middle class. That' double the number in 1993.
Tonight I propose another major expansion of the EITC: to reduce the marriage penalty, to make sure it reward marriage as it reward work, and also to expand the tax credit for family that have more than two child. It punish people with more than two child today. Our proposal would allow family with three or more child to get up to $1,100 more in tax relief. These be work family; their child should not be in poverty.
We also can't reward work and family unless man and woman get equal pay for equal work. Today the female unemployment rate be the low it have be in 46 year. Yet, woman still only earn about 75 cent for every dollar man earn. We must do better, by providing the resource to enforce present equal pay law, train more woman for high-pay, high-tech job, and passing the "Paycheck Fairness Act."
Many work parent spend up to a quarter--a quarter--of their income on child care. Last year, we help parent provide child care for about 2 million child. My child care initiative, before you now, along with fund already secure in welfare reform, would make child care better, safe, and more affordable for another 400,000 child. I ask you to pass that. They need it out there.
For hard-press middle income family, we should also expand the child care tax credit. And I believe strongly we should take the next big step and make that tax credit refundable for low income family. For people making under $30,000 a year, that could mean up to $2,400 for child care cost. You know, we all say we're pro-work and pro-family. Pass this proposal would prove it.
Ten of million of American live from paycheck to paycheck. A hard as they work, they still don't have the opportunity to save. Too few can make use of IRA' and 401k plan. We should do more to help all work family save and accumulate wealth. That' the idea behind the Individual Development Account, the IDA'. I ask you to take that idea to a new level, with new retirement saving account that enable every low- and moderate-income family in America to save for retirement, a first home, a medical emergency, or a college education. I propose to match their contribution, however small, dollar for dollar, every year they save. And I propose to give a major new tax credit to any small business that will provide a meaningful pension to its worker. Those people ought to have retirement as well as the rest of us.
Nearly one in three American child grow up without a father. These child be 5 time more likely to live in poverty than child with both parent at home. Clearly, demanding and support responsible fatherhood be critical to lift all our child out of poverty. We've double child support collection since 1992. And I'm propose to you tough new measure to hold still more father responsible.
But we should recognize that a lot of father want to do right by their child but need help to do it. Carlo Rosas of St. Paul, Minnesota, want to do right by his son, and he got the help to do it. Now he' got a good job, and he support his little boy. My budget will help 40,000 more father make the same choice Carlo Rosas do. I thank him for being here tonight. Stand up, Carlo. [Applause] Thank you.
If there be any single issue on which we should be able to reach across party line, it be in our common commitment to reward work and strengthen family. Just remember what we do last year. We come together to help people with disability keep their health insurance when they go to work. And I thank you for that. Thanks to overwhelming bipartisan support from this Congress, we have improve foster care. We've help those young people who leave it when they turn 18, and we have dramatically increase the number of foster care child go into adoptive home. I thank all of you for all of that.
Of course, I be forever grateful to the person who have led our effort from the beginning and who' work so tirelessly for child and family for 30 year now, my wife, Hillary, and I thank her.
If we take the step just discuss, we can go a long, long way toward empower parent to succeed at home and at work and ensure that no child be raise in poverty. We can make these vital investment in health care, education, support for work family, and still offer tax cut to help pay for college, for retirement, to care for age parent, to reduce the marriage penalty. We can do these thing without forsake the path of fiscal discipline that got us to this point here tonight.
Indeed, we must make these investment and these tax cut in the context of a balance budget that strengthen and extend the life of Social Security and Medicare and pay down the national debt.
Crime in America have drop for the past 7 years--that' the long decline on record--thanks to a national consensus we help to forge on community police, sensible gun safety law, and effective prevention. But nobody, nobody here, nobody in America believe we're safe enough. So again, I ask you to set a high goal. Let' make this country the safe big country in the world.
Last fall, Congress support my plan to hire, in addition to the 100,000 community police we've already fund, 50,000 more, concentrate in high-crime neighborhood. I ask your continue support for that.
Soon after the Columbine tragedy, Congress consider commonsense gun legislation, to require Brady background check at the gun show, child safety lock for new handgun, and a ban on the importation of large-capacity ammunition clip. With courage and a tie-breaking vote by the Vice President--[laughter]--the Senate face down the gun lobby, stand up for the American people, and pass this legislation. But the House fail to follow suit.
Now, we have all see what happen when gun fall into the wrong hand. Daniel Mauser be only 15 year old when he be gun down at Columbine. He be a amazing kid, a straight-A student, a good skier. Like all parent who lose their child, his father, Tom, have bear unimaginable grief. Somehow he have found the strength to honor his son by transform his grief into action. Early this month, he take a leave of absence from his job to fight for tough gun safety law. I pray that his courage and wisdom will at long last move this Congress to make commonsense gun legislation the very next order of business. Tom Mauser, stand up. We thank you for being here tonight. Tom. Thank you, Tom.
We must strengthen our gun law and enforce those already on the book better. Federal gun crime prosecution be up 16 percent since I take office. But we must do more. I propose to hire more Federal and local gun prosecutor and more ATF agent to crack down on illegal gun trafficker and bad-apple dealer. And we must give them the enforcement tool that they need, tool to trace every gun and every bullet use in every gun crime in the Unite State. I ask you to help us do that.
Every State in this country already require hunter and automobile driver to have a license. I think they ought to do the same thing for handgun purchase. Now specifically, I propose a plan to ensure that all new handgun buyer must first have a photo license from their State showing they pass the Brady background check and a gun safety course, before they get the gun. I hope you'll help me pass that in this Congress.
Listen to this--listen to this. The accidental gun rate--the accidental gun death rate of child under 15 in the Unite State be 9 time high than in the other 25 industrialize country combine. Now, technology now exist that could lead to gun that can only be fire by the adult who own them. I ask Congress to fund research into smart gun technology to save these child' live. I ask responsible leader in the gun industry to work with us on smart gun and other step to keep gun out of the wrong hand to keep our child safe.
You know, every parent I know worry about the impact of violence in the media on their child. I want to begin by thank the entertainment industry for accept my challenge to put voluntary rating on TV program and video and Internet game. But frankly, the rating be too numerous, diverse, and confusing to be really useful to parent. So tonight, I ask the industry to accept the First Lady' challenge to develop a single voluntary rating system for all child' entertainment that be easy for parent to understand and enforce. The step I outline will take us well on our way to making America the safe big country in the world.
Now, to keep our historic economic expansion go, the subject of a lot of discussion in this community and others, I believe we need a 21st century revolution to open new market, start new business, hire new worker right here in America, in our inner city, poor rural area, and Native American reservation.
Our Nation' prosperity hasn't yet reach these place. Over the last 6 month, I've travel to a lot of them, join by many of you and many far-sighted business people, to shine a spotlight on the enormous potential in community from Appalachia to the Mississippi Delta, from Watt to the Pine Ridge reservation. Everywhere I go, I meet talented people eager for opportunity and able to work. Tonight I ask you, let' put them to work. For business, it' the smart thing to do. For America, it' the right thing to do. And let me ask you something: If we don't do this now, when in the wide world will we ever get around to it?
So I ask Congress to give business the same incentive to invest in America' new market they now have to invest in market overseas. Tonight I propose a large new market tax credit and other incentive to spur $22 billion in private-sector capital to create new business and new investment in our inner city and rural area. Because empowerment zone have be create these opportunity for 5 year now, I also ask you to increase incentive to invest in them and to create more of them.
And let me say to all of you again what I have try to say at every turn: This be not a Democratic or a Republican issue. Give people a chance to live their dream be a American issue.
Mr. Speaker, it be a powerful moment last November when you join Reverend Jesse Jackson and me in your home State of Illinois and commit to work toward our common goal by combine the best idea from both side of the aisle. I want to thank you again and to tell you, Mr. Speaker, I look forward to work with you. This be a worthy joint endeavor. Thank you.
I also ask you to make special effort to address the area of our Nation with the high rate of poverty, our Native American reservation and the Mississippi Delta. My budget include a $110 million initiative to promote economic development in the Delta and a billion dollar to increase economic opportunity, health care, education, and law enforcement for our Native American community. We should begin this new century by honor our historic responsibility to empower the first American. And I want to thank tonight the leader and the member from both party who've express to me a interest in work with us on these effort. They be profoundly important.
There' another part of our American community in trouble tonight, our family farmer. When I sign the farm bill in 1996, I said there be great danger it would work well in good time but not in bad. Well, drought, flood, and historically low price have made these time very bad for the farmer. We must work together to strengthen the farm safety net, invest in land conservation, and create some new market for them by expand our program for bio-based fuel and product. Please, they need help. Let' do it together.
Opportunity for all require something else today, have access to a computer and knowing how to use it. That mean we must close the digital divide between those who've got the tool and those who don't. Connect classroom and library to the Internet be crucial, but it' just a start. My budget ensure that all new teacher be train to teach 21st century skill, and it create technology center in 1,000 community to serve adult. This spring, I'll invite high-tech leader to join me on another new market tour, to close the digital divide and open opportunity for our people. I want to thank the high-tech company that already be do so much in this area. I hope the new tax incentive I have propose will get all the rest of them to join us. This be a national crusade. We have got to do this and do it quickly.
Now, again I say to you, these be step, but step by step, we can go a long way toward our goal of bring opportunity to every community.
To realize the full possibility of this economy, we must reach beyond our own border, to shape the revolution that be tear down barrier and building new network among nation and individual and economy and culture: globalization. It' the central reality of our time.
Of course, change this profound be both liberate and threaten to people. But there' no turning back. And our open, creative society stand to benefit more than any other if we understand and act on the reality of interdependence. We have to be at the center of every vital global network, as a good neighbor and a good partner. We have to recognize that we cannot build our future without helping others to build theirs.
The first thing we have got to do be to forge a new consensus on trade. Now, those of us who believe passionately in the power of open trade, we have to ensure that it lift both our living standard and our value, never tolerate abusive child labor or a race to the bottom in the environment and worker protection. But others must recognize that open market and rule-based trade be the best engine we know of for raise living standard, reduce global poverty and environmental destruction, and assure the free flow of idea.
I believe, as strongly tonight as I do the first day I got here, the only direction forward for America on trade--the only direction for America on trade be to keep go forward. I ask you to help me forge that consensus. We have to make develop economy our partner in prosperity. That' why I would like to ask you again to finalize our groundbreaking African and Caribbean Basin trade initiative.
But globalization be about more than economics. Our purpose must be to bring together the world around freedom and democracy and peace and to oppose those who would tear it apart. Here be the fundamental challenge I believe America must meet to shape the 21st century world.
First, we must continue to encourage our former adversary, Russia and China, to emerge as stable, prosperous, democratic nation. Both be being held back today from reach their full potential: Russia by the legacy of communism, a economy in turmoil, a cruel and self-defeating war in Chechnya; China by the illusion that it can buy stability at the expense of freedom.
But think how much have change in the past decade: 5,000 former Soviet nuclear weapon taken out of commission; Russian soldier actually serving with ours in the Balkans; Russian people elect their leader for the first time in a thousand year; and in China, a economy more open to the world than ever before.
Of course, no one, not a single person in this Chamber tonight can know for sure what direction these great nation will take. But we do know for sure that we can choose what we do. And we should do everything in our power to increase the chance that they will choose wisely, to be constructive member of our global community.
That' why we should support those Russian who be struggle for a democratic, prosperous future; continue to reduce both our nuclear arsenal; and help Russia to safeguard weapon and material that remain.
And that' why I believe Congress should support the agreement we negotiate to bring China into the WTO, by passing permanent normal trade relation with China as soon as possible this year.
I think you ought to do it for two reason: First of all, our market be already open to China; this agreement will open China' market to us; and second, it will plainly advance the cause of peace in Asia and promote the cause of change in China. No, we don't know where it' go. All we can do be decide what we're go to do. But when all be said and do, we need to know we do everything we possibly could to maximize the chance that China will choose the right future.
A second challenge we've got be to protect our own security from conflict that pose the risk of wide war and threaten our common humanity. We can't prevent every conflict or stop every outrage. But where our interest be at stake and we can make a difference, we should be, and we must be, peacemaker.
We should be proud of our role in bring the Middle East close to a lasting peace, building peace in Northern Ireland, work for peace in East Timor and Africa, promote reconciliation between Greece and Turkey and in Cyprus, work to defuse these crise between India and Pakistan, in defend human right and religious freedom. And we should be proud of the man and woman of our Arm Force and those of our ally who stop the ethnic cleansing in Kosovo, enable a million people to return to their home.
When Slobodan Milosevic unleash his terror on Kosovo, Captain John Cherrey be one of the brave airman who turn the tide. And when another American plane be shot down over Serbia, he fly into the tooth of enemy air defense to bring his fellow pilot home. Thanks to our Arm Force' skill and bravery, we prevail in Kosovo without lose a single American in combat. I want to introduce Captain Cherrey to you. We honor Captain Cherrey, and we promise you, Captain, we'll finish the job you begin. Stand up so we can see you.
A third challenge we have be to keep this inexorable march of technology from give terrorist and potentially hostile nation the mean to undermine our defense. Keep in mind, the same technological advance that have shrink cell phone to fit in the palm of our hand can also make weapon of terror easy to conceal and easy to use.
We must meet this threat by making effective agreement to restrain nuclear and missile program in North Korea, curb the flow of lethal technology to Iran, prevent Iraq from threaten its neighbor, increasing our preparedness against chemical and biological attack, protect our vital computer system from hacker and criminal, and develop a system to defend against new missile threat, while work to preserve our ABM missile treaty with Russia. We must do all these thing.
I predict to you, when most of us be long go but some time in the next 10 to 20 year, the major security threat this country will face will come from the enemy of the nation state: the narcotrafficker and the terrorist and the organize criminal, who will be organize together, work together, with increasing access to ever-more sophisticate chemical and biological weapon. And I want to thank the Pentagon and others for do what they're do right now to try to help protect us and plan for that, so that our defense will be strong. I ask for your support to ensure they can succeed.
I also want to ask you for a constructive bipartisan dialog this year to work to build a consensus which I hope will eventually lead to the ratification of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty.
I hope we can also have a constructive effort to meet the challenge that be present to our planet by the huge gulf between rich and poor. We cannot accept a world in which part of humanity live on the cutting edge of a new economy and the rest live on the bare edge of survival. I think we have to do our part to change that with expand trade, expand aid, and the expansion of freedom.
This be interesting: From Nigeria to Indonesia, more people got the right to choose their leader in 1999 than in 1989, when the Berlin Wall fell. We've got to stand by these democracy, including, and especially tonight, Colombia, which be fighting narcotrafficker, for its own people' live and our child' live. I have propose a strong 2-year package to help Colombia win this fight. I want to thank the leader in both party in both House for listen to me and the President of Colombia about it. We have got to pass this. I want to ask your help. A lot be riding on it. And it' so important for the long-term stability of our country and for what happen in Latin America.
I also want you to know I'm go to send you new legislation to go after what these drug baron value the most, their money. And I hope you'll pass that as well.
In a world where over a billion people live on less than a dollar a day, we also have got to do our part in the global endeavor to reduce the debt of the poor country, so they can invest in education, health care, and economic growth. That' what the Pope and other religious leader have urge us to do. And last year, Congress made a downpayment on America' share. I ask you to continue that. I thank you for what you do and ask you to stay the course.
I also want to say that America must help more nation to break the bond of disease. Last year in Africa, 10 time as many people die from AIDS as be kill in wars--10 time. The budget I give you invest $150 million more in the fight against this and other infectious killer. And today I propose a tax credit to speed the development of vaccine for disease like malaria, TB, and AIDS. I ask the private sector and our partner around the world to join us in embrace this cause. We can save million of live together, and we ought to do it.
I also want to mention our final challenge, which, as always, be the most important. I ask you to pass a national security budget that keep our military the best train and best equip in the world, with heighten readiness and 21st century weapon, which raise salary for our service man and woman, which protect our veteran, which fully fund the diplomacy that keep our soldier out of war, which make good on our commitment to our U.N. due and arrears. I ask you to pass this budget.
I also want to say something, if I might, very personal tonight. The American people watch us at home, with the help of all the commentator, can tell, from who stand and who sit and who clap and who doesn't, that there' still modest difference of opinion in this room. [Laughter] But I want to thank you for something, every one of you. I want to thank you for the extraordinary support you have give, Republican and Democrat alike, to our man and woman in uniform. I thank you for that.
I also want to thank, especially, two people. First, I want to thank our Secretary of Defense, Bill Cohen, for symbolize our bipartisan commitment to national security. Thank you, sir. Even more, I want to thank his wife, Janet, who, more than any other American citizen, have tirelessly travel this world to show the support we all feel for our troop. Thank you, Janet Cohen. I appreciate that. Thank you.
These be the challenge we have to meet so that we can lead the world toward peace and freedom in a era of globalization.
I want to tell you that I be very grateful for many thing as President. But one of the thing I'm grateful for be the opportunity that the Vice President and I have have to finally put to rest the bogus idea that you cannot grow the economy and protect the environment at the same time.
A our economy have grown, we've rid more than 500 neighborhood of toxic waste, ensure cleaner air and water for million of people. In the past 3 month alone, we've help preserve 40 million acre of roadless land in the national forest, create three new national monument.
But as our community grow, our commitment to conservation must continue to grow. Tonight I propose create a permanent conservation fund, to restore wildlife, protect coastline, save natural treasure, from the California redwood to the Florida Everglade.
This land legacy endowment would represent by far the most endure investment in land preservation ever propose in this House. I hope we can get together with all the people with different idea and do this. This be a gift we should give to our child and our grandchild for all time, across party line. We can make a agreement to do this.
Last year the Vice President launch a new effort to make community more liberal--livable--[laughter]--liberal, I know. [Laughter] Wait a minute, I've got a punchline now. That' this year' agenda; last year be livable, right? [Laughter] That' what Senator Lott be go to say in the commentary afterwards--[laughter]--to make our community more livable. This be big business. This be a big issue. What do that mean? You ask anybody that live in a unlivable community, and they'll tell you. They want their kid to grow up next to park, not parking lot; the parent don't have to spend all their time stall in traffic when they could be home with their child.
Tonight I ask you to support new fund for the following thing, to make American community for liberal--livable. [Laughter] I've do pretty well with this speech, but I can't say that.
One, I want you to help us to do three thing. We need more fund for advance transit system. We need more fund for saving open space in place of heavy development. And we need more funding--this ought to have bipartisan appeal--we need more fund for helping major city around the Great Lake protect their waterway and enhance their quality of life. We need these thing, and I want you to help us.
The great environmental challenge of the new century be global warm. The scientist tell us the 1990' be the hot decade of the entire millennium. If we fail to reduce the emission of greenhouse gase, deadly heat wave and drought will become more frequent, coastal area will flood, and economy will be disrupt. That be go to happen, unless we act.
Many people in the Unite State, some people in this Chamber, and lot of folk around the world still believe you cannot cut greenhouse gas emission without slow economic growth. In the industrial age, that may well have be true. But in this digital economy, it be not true anymore. New technology make it possible to cut harmful emission and provide even more growth.
For example, just last week, automaker unveil car that get 70 to 80 mile a gallon, the fruit of a unique research partnership between Government and industry. And before you know it, efficient production of bio-fuel will give us the equivalent of hundred of mile from a gallon of gasoline.
To speed innovation in these kind of technology, I think we should give a major tax incentive to business for the production of clean energy and to family for buy energy-saving home and appliance and the next generation of super efficient car when they hit the showroom floor. I also ask the auto industry to use the available technology to make all new car more fuel-efficient right away.
And I ask this Congress to do something else. Please help us make more of our clean energy technology available to the develop world. That will create cleaner growth abroad and a lot more new job here in the Unite State of America.
In the new century, innovation in science and technology will be key not only to the health of the environment but to miraculous improvement in the quality of our live and advance in the economy. Later this year, researcher will complete the first draft of the entire human genome, the very blueprint of life. It be important for all our fellow American to recognize that Federal tax dollar have fund much of this research and that this and other wise investment in science be leading to a revolution in our ability to detect, treat, and prevent disease.
For example, researcher have identify gene that cause Parkinson', diabetes, and certain kind of cancer; they be design precision therapy that will block the harmful effect of these gene for good. Researcher already be use this new technique to target and destroy cell that cause breast cancer. Soon, we may be able to use it to prevent the onset of Alzheimer'. Scientist be also work on a artificial retina to help many blind people to see and--listen to this-- microchip that would actually directly stimulate damage spinal cord in a way that could allow people now paralyze to stand up and walk.
These kind of innovation be also propel our remarkable prosperity. Information technology only include 8 percent of our employment, but now it count for a third of our economic growth along with job that pay, by the way, about 80 percent above the private sector average. Again, we ought to keep in mind, Government-fund research brought supercomputer, the Internet, and communications satellite into being. Soon researcher will bring us device that can translate foreign language as fast as you can talk, material 10 time strong than steel at a fraction of the weight, and--this be unbelievable to me--molecular computer the size of a teardrop with the power of today' fast supercomputer.
To accelerate the march of discovery across all these discipline in science and technology, I ask you to support my recommendation of a unprecedented $3 billion in the 21st century research fund, the large increase in civilian research in a generation. We owe it to our future.
Now, these new breakthrough have to be use in way that reflect our value. First and foremost, we have to safeguard our citizen' privacy. Last year we propose to protect every citizen' medical record. This year we will finalize those rule. We've also taken the first step to protect the privacy of bank and credit card record and other financial statement. Soon I will send legislation to you to finish that job. We must also act to prevent any genetic discrimination whatever by employer or insurer. I hope you will support that.
These step will allow us to lead toward the far frontier of science and technology. They will enhance our health, the environment, the economy in way we can't even imagine today. But we all know that at a time when science, technology, and the force of globalization be bring so many change into all our live, it' more important than ever that we strengthen the bond that root us in our local community and in our national community.
No tie bind different people together like citizen service. There' a new spirit of service in America, a movement we've try to support with AmeriCorps, expand Peace Corps, unprecedented new partnership with business, foundation, community group; partnership, for example, like the one that enlist 12,000 company which have now move 650,000 of our fellow citizen from welfare to work; partnership to battle drug abuse, AIDS, teach young people to read, save America' treasure, strengthen the art, fight teen pregnancy, prevent violence among young people, promote racial heal. The American people be work together.
But we should do more to help American help each other. First, we should help faith-based organization to do more to fight poverty and drug abuse and help people get back on the right track, with initiative like Second Chance Home that do so much to help unwed teen mother. Second, we should support American who tithe and contribute to charity but don't earn enough to claim a tax deduction for it. Tonight I propose new tax incentive that would allow low and middle income citizen who don't itemize to get that deduction. It' nothing but fair, and it will get more people to give.
We should do more to help new immigrant to fully participate in our community. That' why I recommend spend more to teach them civic and English. And since everybody in our community count, we've got to make sure everyone be count in this year' census.
Within 10 years--just 10 years--there will be no majority race in our large State of California. In a little more than 50 year, there will be no majority race in America. In a more interconnect world, this diversity can be our great strength. Just look around this Chamber. Look around. We have Member in this Congress from virtually every racial, ethnic, and religious background. And I think you would agree that America be strong because of it. [Applause]
You also have to agree that all those difference you just clap for all too often spark hatred and division even here at home. Just in the last couple of year, we've see a man drag to death in Texas just because he be black. We saw a young man murder in Wyoming just because he be gay. Last year we saw the shooting of African-American, Asian-American, and Jewish child just because of who they be. This be not the American way, and we must draw the line.
I ask you to draw that line by passing without delay the "Hate Crime Prevention Act" and the "Employment Non-Discrimination Act." And I ask you to reauthorize the Violence Against Woman Act.
Finally tonight, I propose the large ever investment in our civil right law for enforcement, because no American should be subject to discrimination in finding a home, get a job, go to school, or secure a loan. Protection in law should be protection in fact.
Last February, because I thought this be so important, I create the White House Office of One America to promote racial reconciliation. That' what one of my personal hero, Hank Aaron, have do all his life. From his day as our all-time home run king to his recent act of heal, he have always brought people together. We should follow his example, and we're honor to have him with us tonight. Stand up, Hank Aaron.
I just want to say one more thing about this, and I want every one of you to think about this the next time you get mad at one of your colleague on the other side of the aisle. This fall, at the White House, Hillary have one of her millennium dinner, and we have this very distinguish scientist there, who be a expert in this whole work in the human genome. And he said that we be all, regardless of race, genetically 99.9 percent the same.
Now, you may find that uncomfortable when you look around here. [Laughter] But it be worth remember. We can laugh about this, but you think about it. Modern science have confirm what ancient faith have always taught: the most important fact of life be our common humanity. Therefore, we should do more than just tolerate our diversity; we should honor it and celebrate it.
My fellow American, every time I prepare for the State of the Union, I approach it with hope and expectation and excitement for our Nation. But tonight be very special, because we stand on the mountain top of a new millennium. Behind us we can look back and see the great expanse of American achievement, and before us we can see even great, grand frontier of possibility. We should, all of us, be fill with gratitude and humility for our present progress and prosperity. We should be fill with awe and joy at what lie over the horizon. And we should be fill with absolute determination to make the most of it.
You know, when the Framer finish craft our Constitution in Philadelphia, Benjamin Franklin stand in Independence Hall, and he reflect on the carving of the Sun that be on the back of a chair he saw. The Sun be low on the horizon. So he said this--he said, "I've often wonder whether that Sun be rise or setting. Today," Franklin said, "I have the happiness to know it' a rise Sun." Today, because each succeeding generation of American have kept the fire of freedom burning brightly, lighting those frontier of possibility, we all still bask in the glow and the warmth of Mr. Franklin' rise sun.
After 224 year, the American revolution continue. We remain a new nation. And as long as our dream outweigh our memory, America will be forever young. That be our destiny. And this be our moment.
Thank you, God bless you, and God bless America.
